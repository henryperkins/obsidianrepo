**user**: [Secure Key Management Guide](./Secure%20Key%20Management%20Guide.md) compare the config.py to this [config.py](config.py.md)
[Timestamp: 2024/11/29 21:15:33]

**ai**: It seems that the content of `[[Untitled 14]]` is not a Python configuration file, but rather a series of strings or keys, possibly related to some kind of credentials or identifiers. On the other hand, `[[config.py]]` is a detailed Python script for configuring an Azure OpenAI service, including environment variable handling, validation, and configuration management.

To compare these two, it would be necessary to understand the purpose of the strings in `[[Untitled 14]]`. If they are meant to be used as environment variables or configuration values, you might want to check if they correspond to any of the required or optional environment variables in `config.py`, such as `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`, etc.

If you have specific elements you want to compare or if there's more context about what `[[Untitled 14]]` represents, please provide additional details.
