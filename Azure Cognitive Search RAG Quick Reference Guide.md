        {"name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": True},
        {"name": "embedding", "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)", 
         "dimensions": 1536, "vectorSearchProfile": "default"}
    ]

- Implement natural language understanding
- Enhance ranking with semantic capabilities

### 4. OpenAI Integration
üìö [Azure OpenAI Integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings)
```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(azure_endpoint=endpoint, api_key=key)
embedding = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-ada-002",
    input="text"
).data[0].embedding
```
Key Points:
- Generate embeddings for vector search
- Integrate with Azure OpenAI services
- Handle embedding operations

### 5. Pipeline Components
üìö [Pipeline Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/tutorial-rag-build-solution-pipeline)
```python
# Skillset example
skillset = {
    "skills": [
        {
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.SplitSkill",
            "textSplitMode": "pages"
        }
    ]
}

# Indexer setup
indexer = {
    "name": "my-indexer",
    "dataSourceName": "source",
    "targetIndexName": "index"
}
```
Key Points:
- Create and manage skillsets
- Configure indexers
- Set up data processing pipeline

This quick reference provides essential code snippets and patterns for implementing RAG with Azure Cognitive Search. For detailed implementations, refer to the linked documentation and samples.

The GitHub repository you linked, `jelledruyts/azure-ai-search-lab`, contains several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various aspects of Azure AI Search.  While I can't directly execute the code within the notebooks, I can provide a structured summary of the functionalities showcased and highlight key code snippets for reference.  This summary will focus on the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) aspects.


**Key Notebooks and Functionalities:**

The repository appears to focus on building a robust and scalable RAG system using Azure AI Search.  Key functionalities demonstrated include:

* **Data Ingestion and Preparation:**  The notebooks likely demonstrate how to ingest data into Azure AI Search, potentially including cleaning, transformation, and enrichment steps.  This is crucial for building a high-quality knowledge base.

* **Embedding Generation:**  A significant part likely involves generating embeddings for the ingested data using OpenAI's embedding models.  This transforms textual data into numerical vectors suitable for semantic search.

* **Index Creation and Management:**  The notebooks will show how to create and manage indices in Azure AI Search, specifically configuring them for vector search.  This includes defining schema, specifying vector fields, and potentially setting up semantic ranking capabilities.

* **Querying and Retrieval:**  The core of the RAG system is demonstrated through querying the index.  This involves sending queries (either keyword-based or vector-based) to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base.

* **Response Generation:**  The retrieved documents are then used to generate a comprehensive answer using a language model (likely OpenAI's).  This step combines the retrieved information to create a coherent and informative response.

* **Advanced Features:**  The repository might explore more advanced features like:
    * **Skillsets:**  Using Azure AI Search skillsets to pre-process documents before indexing.
    * **Semantic Ranking:**  Leveraging semantic search capabilities for improved relevance.
    * **Incremental Indexing:**  Efficiently updating the index with new data.


**Example Code Snippets (Hypothetical - based on common practices):**

Without directly accessing and running the notebooks, I can only provide examples of code snippets that are commonly used in such a system:

**1. Embedding Generation (using OpenAI):**

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
response = openai.Embedding.create(
    input="<YOUR_TEXT>",
    model="text-embedding-ada-002"
)
embedding = response['data'][0]['embedding']
```

**2. Azure AI Search Index Creation (simplified):**

```python
from azure.search.documents.indexes import SearchIndexClient, SearchIndex

index_client = SearchIndexClient(endpoint="<YOUR_ENDPOINT>", credential=AzureKeyCredential("<YOUR_API_KEY>"))

index = SearchIndex(
    name="<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>",
    fields=[
        {"name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": True, "searchable": False},
        {"name": "content", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": True},
        {"name": "embedding", "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)", "dimensions": 1536}
    ]
)

index_client.create_index(index)
```

**3. Azure AI Search Query (vector search):**

```python
from azure.search.documents import SearchClient

search_client = SearchClient(endpoint="<YOUR_ENDPOINT>", index_name="<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>", credential=AzureKeyCredential("<YOUR_API_KEY>"))

results = search_client.search(
    vector=embedding,
    vector_fields="embedding",
    top=5
)

for result in results:
    print(result["content"])
```


To get precise code examples, you should directly explore the Jupyter notebooks within the `jelledruyts/azure-ai-search-lab` repository.  Look for cells containing code related to embedding generation, index creation, querying, and response generation.  Remember to replace placeholder values with your own Azure AI Search and OpenAI credentials.
