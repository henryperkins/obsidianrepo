- Implement robust error handling and logging.
- Consider ethical implications and data privacy when working with sensitive content.

**Evaluation:**

- The success of the AI assistant will be evaluated based on:
    - The quality and efficiency of the generated code.
    - The accuracy and completeness of the data processing and analysis.
    - The effectiveness of the tagging and classification system.
    - The clarity and usefulness of the documentation.

**Title and description**
### **AI-Powered Video Processing System with Qwen2-VL**

Design and implement a robust video processing pipeline that leverages the power of the Qwen2-VL model for content understanding. The system will download videos from provided URLs, extract rich metadata using FFmpeg, detect scene changes, and utilize Qwen2-VL to generate descriptions, answer targeted questions about the video content, and perform sentiment analysis. The system will then apply a combination of rule-based and AI-powered tagging to categorize videos and store all information in a MongoDB database for efficient search and retrieval.

## Task Description: Building an AI-Powered Video Downloader and Analyzer

**Objective:**

Develop a Python-based system that automates the process of downloading, analyzing, and tagging videos, leveraging the power of the Qwen2-VL multimodal AI model for content understanding.

**Key Functionalities:**

1. **Video Download:**
   - Download videos from user-provided URLs, handling redirects and potential network errors.
   - Track download progress and provide feedback to the user.

2. **Metadata Extraction:**
   - Utilize FFmpeg to extract comprehensive metadata from video files, including:
     - Technical details: Duration, resolution, frame rate, video and audio codecs, bitrate, audio channels, and subtitle presence.
     - Content-specific information: Scene changes, potentially identifying key objects or actions within scenes.

3. **Qwen2-VL Analysis:**
   - Integrate the Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct model to:
     - Generate detailed descriptions of video content.
     - Answer targeted questions about specific actions, scenes, or objects in the videos.
     - Analyze the sentiment expressed in the video content.

4. **Automated Tagging:**
   - Develop a hybrid tagging system that combines:
     - Rule-based tagging based on filename patterns, extracted metadata, and video source.
     - AI-powered tagging using insights from the Qwen2-VL model's analysis.

5. **Video Classification:**
   - Implement a classification system to categorize videos into broader genres or topics (e.g., sports, music, educational) based on combined metadata and Qwen2-VL outputs.

6. **Database Storage:**
   - Store all extracted metadata, tags, Qwen2-VL analysis results, and classification categories in a MongoDB Atlas database for efficient search, retrieval, and analysis.

7. **(Optional) Cloud Storage Integration:**
   - Optionally integrate with a cloud storage service like Dropbox to store the downloaded video files.

**Target Users:**

- Researchers and developers building video datasets for machine learning.
- Content creators and managers seeking to organize and analyze large video collections.
- Individuals interested in automating video downloads and gaining insights into video content.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A robust and efficient system for downloading, processing, and analyzing videos.
- A comprehensive database of video information, including rich metadata, tags, and AI-generated insights.
- A user-friendly interface (command-line or GUI) for interacting with the system.

**Challenges:**

- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of rule-based and AI-powered tagging.
- Optimizing performance for handling large video datasets and computationally intensive Qwen2-VL processing.
- Addressing ethical considerations and data privacy, especially when dealing with sensitive content.

This task aims to create a powerful tool that leverages cutting-edge AI technology to streamline video processing, enhance content understanding, and facilitate the creation of valuable video datasets.
