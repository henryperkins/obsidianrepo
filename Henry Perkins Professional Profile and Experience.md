## Summary

With a solid foundation in technical support and a proven track record in customer service, I excel in engaging diverse communities and mastering web technologies. My experience includes significant roles such as Community Manager at PageLines, Inc., where I built a dynamic network of WordPress experts and forged essential brand partnerships. At Automattic, I provided exceptional technical guidance and billing assistance to WordPress.com users, ensuring seamless user experiences.

Transitioning to retail management, I demonstrated leadership at Sodexo and refined my customer service skills as a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks. In these roles, I was pivotal in boosting sales and maintaining high customer satisfaction and safety standards.

My career highlights my dedication to delivering top-notch professional service. With a skill set that includes technical expertise and interpersonal finesse, I am eager to bring my enthusiasm for client engagement and operational excellence to a receptionist position on a cruise ship, where I can contribute to a vibrant onboard community and ensure memorable guest experiences.
