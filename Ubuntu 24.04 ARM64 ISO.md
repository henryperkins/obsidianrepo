It appears that you're referring to a specific ISO image for a daily build of Ubuntu, designed for the noble-desktop environment on an ARM64 architecture, specifically tailored for the x13s hardware (which could be a model of a laptop or device). However, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to directly interact with web content or download files.

Please note that daily builds are unstable and are used for testing and development purposes. They contain the latest code that developers have submitted, which has not yet been thoroughly tested. If you're looking to install Ubuntu on your device, it's recommended to use the stable release unless you need the very latest features and are willing to deal with potential bugs.

If you need this particular daily build and you know how to handle it, you can download it by visiting the provided link in a web browser.

Keep in mind that installing an operating system can erase all data on your device. It's important to back up any important information before proceeding with an installation, especially when using development versions of software.

Lastly, be aware that my response is based on information available up until my last knowledge update in April 2023. If there have been any changes or updates after this time, I may not be aware of them.

## How to create a bootable usb drive with Ubuntu 24.04 for my Lenovo x13s ARM64 laptop 

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Ubuntu 24.04 has not been officially released, so this information is based on the assumption that the process for creating a bootable USB drive for Ubuntu will be similar to previous versions. To create a bootable USB drive for your Lenovo x13s ARM64 laptop, assuming you have access to an Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 image when it becomes available, you can follow these steps:

1. Download Ubuntu:
   - Visit the official Ubuntu website (https://ubuntu.com/) and navigate to the download section.
   - Look for the ARM64 (also known as AArch64) version of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS suitable for your Lenovo x13s.
   - Download the ISO image file to your computer.

2. Insert a USB Flash Drive:
   - Insert a USB flash drive with at least 4GB of storage into your computer.
   - Be aware that all data on the USB drive will be erased during this process.

3. Use a Bootable USB Creator Tool:
   You'll need a tool that can create a bootable USB drive from an ISO image file. For different operating systems, you can use different tools:

   - On Windows: Use Rufus (https://rufus.ie/) or balenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
   - On macOS: Use balenaEtcher or use the `dd` command-line utility.
   - On Linux: Use Startup Disk Creator if it's included in your distribution, balenaEtcher, or `dd`.

4. Create the Bootable Drive:
   Assuming you're using Rufus on Windows:

   - Open Rufus.
   - Select your USB drive under "Device."
   - Click "Select" next to "Boot selection" and choose your downloaded Ubuntu ISO file.
   - For "Partition scheme," select GPT if your system uses UEFI or MBR for BIOS systems (most modern systems use UEFI).
   - Choose "FAT32" as the file system if it's not already selected by default.
   - Make sure "Create a bootable disk using" is set to "ISO Image."
   - Click "Start" and wait for Rufus to finish creating the bootable drive.

5. Boot from USB:
   
- With the bootable USB drive created, insert it into your Lenovo x13s laptop.
- Turn on or restart your laptop and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup by pressing a specific key during boot-up (common keys are F1, F2, F10, Delete, or Esc; check your laptop’s manual for exact instructions).
- In BIOS/UEFI settings, disable Secure Boot if necessary since some Linux distributions might not support it out of the box.
- Change the boot order so that the system boots from USB first or choose to manually select a one-time boot device usually through an F12 menu or similar.
- Save changes and exit BIOS/UEFI setup.

6. Install Ubuntu:

- Your Lenovo x13s should now be booted into live mode from the Ubuntu installation media on ARM64 architecture.
- Follow on-screen instructions to try out Ubuntu live without installing or proceed with installation onto your system’s internal storage.

7. Troubleshooting:
   
If you encounter issues with hardware compatibility due to the ARM architecture—like Wi-Fi not working—you may need additional drivers or kernel modules which could be available through forums, Github repositories dedicated to ARM devices running Linux, or even official support channels depending on when you attempt this process.


## How to upgrade distributions through the command line of 222 to 23

 It seems like you're asking about upgrading a Linux distribution from one version to another, but the versions you mentioned ("222" and "23") do not correspond to any standard naming convention for Linux distributions. It's possible that you are referring to a specific distribution's versioning system, but without more context, it's difficult to provide precise instructions.

However, I can give you a general idea of how upgrades are typically done via the command line in Linux. Most major distributions have a version upgrade mechanism that can be triggered via their package management systems.

Here are general steps for upgrading some of the most popular distributions:

**For Ubuntu-based distributions** (e.g., from 22.04 LTS to 23.04):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

**For Fedora** (e.g., from 32 to 33):

```bash
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
sudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=33
sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
```

**For Debian-based distributions**:

Debian doesn't have a simple version number like "222" or "23," but if you're upgrading from one major release to another (e.g., Buster to Bullseye), you would:

1. Update `/etc/apt/sources.list` to point to the new release.
2. Run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Please replace "33" or "Bullseye" with the correct version number or codename for your specific distribution.

If you provide more information about which exact distribution and versions you're referring to, I could give you a more accurate set of instructions for upgrading through the command line.
