# How to Identify, Categorize, and Index Legal Pornographic Content Using AI Models
## YOU

Is priority_keywords.json and custom_tags.json both necessary? Define the difference and purpose between the two. Also, are they integrated into the script as outlined in the explanation and summary sections in the note?

## BMO

Great question! Let's discuss the difference between `priority_keywords.json` `custom_tags.json`, their purposes, if they are both necessary for your video processing toolkit.

# 1. **Difference And Purpose**

# **`priority_keywords.json`**
* **Purpose**:
   * The primary purpose of `priority_keywords.json` is to provide a list of keywords or phrases that you'd like the Qwen2-VL model (or another AI model) to prioritize or focus on when generating content descriptions, tags, or summaries.
   * These keywords influence how the AI model interprets and describes the video content, ensuring the output aligns closely with specific terms that are important for your use case.
   * Essentially, it's used to *steer* the AI's output by making certain keywords or concepts more prominent.
* **Usage Scenario**:
   * Suppose you're working with action footage and want the AI to prioritize terms like "explosive," "fight scene," or "car chase." By including in `priority_keywords.json`, you guide the AI to emphasize these aspects in its descriptions.

* **How it Works**:
   * When submitting a request to the AI model, the script would include these keywords as part of the instruction/query sent to the model.

# **`_tags.json`**
* **Purpose**:
   * `custom_tags.json` serves as a rule set for tagging videos within the script. These custom rules allow you to map certain criteria in the video content (be it from metadata, AI description, etc.) to specific tags that the script will apply.
   * It's essentially a *post-processing step* that uses pre-defined rules to generate custom tags based on metadata, AI-generated descriptions, or other video properties
* **Usage Scenario**:
   * If you have specific criteria—like tagging all videos longer than 10 minutes with " Play" or tagging any video with "night shot" in its AI description with "Night-time Filming"—you define these rules within `custom_tags.json`.
* **How it Works**:
   * During the video processing pipeline, the script checks each video's metadata and AI description against the rules defined in `custom_tags.json` and then applies relevant tags.

# **Key Differences**
* **Functionality**:
  * **`priority_keywords.json`** guides what the AI model focuses on when generating content descriptions.
  * **`custom_tags.json`** applies specific tags to the video based on predefined rules after the AI model has produced descriptions.

* **Process**:
  * **`priority_keywords.json`** affects the *input* to the AI model (i.e., the instructions provided to it).
  * **`custom_tags.json`** affects the *output* of the tagging process within the script, using the data provided by the AI model.

# 2. **Are Both Necessary?**

* **Dependency**:
  * The scripts discussed do separate tasks—one influences the AI model's behavior, and the other applies tags based on output from the AI model or metadata.
  * They address *different stages* of the processing pipeline, so technically, both can be useful if you have specific needs for guiding AI output AND custom tagging.

* **Scenario Where Both Are Beneficial**:
  * If you have precise terminology you want emphasized (via `priority_keywords.json`) *and* have custom tagging rules that reflect your organization's tagging standards (via `custom_tags.json`), both are necessary since they operate in tandem.
* **Simplification**:
  * If your use case doesn't demand AI-guided content emphasis and only requires specific tagging rules, you could omit `priority_keywords.json`.
  * Conversely, if you don't need custom tagging after the AI generates descriptions, then you could skip `custom_tags.json`.

# 3. **Integration Status**

# **Integration Into the Script**

Based on the explanation and summaries in the note:

* **`priority_keywords.json` Integration**:
  * Suggested but not heavily emphasized or implemented in the original workflows.
  * The querying function would append these keywords to the instruction sent to the AI model, which affects how the AI prioritizes content in its output.

* **`custom_tags.json` Integration**:
  * Fully integrated into the scriptspecifically mentioned in `tagging.py` where rules defined in `custom_tags.json` are applied during the tagging phase.

# **Priority Of Integration**

* **Completed Integration**:
  * `custom_tags.json` is added into the tagging strategy within the script, handling specific post-processing rules for video tagging.

* **Suggested Integration**:
  * `priority_keywords.json` was suggested and provided for improving AI-model guidance but would require you to ensure it is correctly linked when building the AI query that interacts with Qwen2-VL (or a similar model).

# **Summary**

* **Differences**:
  -priority_keywords.json` influences how the AI analyzes and describes the content (input-focused).
  * `custom_tags.json` applies rules to tag videos after the AI description is generated (output-focused).

* **Necessity**:
  * Both files could be necessary based on the complexity and specifics of your use case. If you need to guide how AI describes as well as customize how tags are applied later, each serves its distinct purpose.
* **Integration**:
  * `custom_tags.json` is currently integrated within the tagging logic.
  * `priority_keywords.json` is suggested but needs to be explicitly connected to the AI querying function if you decide it's necessary.

Let me know if you'd like to take this conversation forward with implementation specifics or have additional queries!

## YOU

What do you mean by "ensure it is correctly linked when building the AI query that interacts with Qwen2-VL? Where is this query currently and what is it asking?

## BMO

Let's break down what I meant by "ensure it is correctly linked when building the AI query that interacts with Qwen2-VL" and how this ties into the current implementation.

# 1. **Understanding The AI Query with Qwen2-VL**

In your script, the AI query that interacts with Qwen2-VL (the Vision-Language model from Alibaba) is a critical step that sends video URLs and specific instructions to the AI model. This query determines how the AI model processes and describes the video content.

# **Where This Query is Currently Located**

The AI query is found in the function `query_qwen_vl_chat()` found in `core.py`. Here's how the query process is structured:

```python
def query_qwen_vl_chat(video_url, instruction="Describe this video.", use_vpc=False):
    """
    Sends a request to the Qwen-VL-Chat model API over HTTPS to process a video.

    Args:
        video_url (str): The URL of the video file.
        instruction (str): The instruction or query to be passed to the AI model.
        use_vpc (bool): Whether to use the VPC endpoint instead of the public one.

    Returns:
        str: The model's response, typically a description or analysis of the.
    """
    # Load from config with fallbacks
    public_endpoint = config.get("QwenVL",PublicEndpoint", fallback="https://your-public-endpoint")
    vpc_endpoint = config.get("QwenVL", "VpcEndpoint", fallback="https://your-vpc-endpoint")
    access_key = config.get("QwenVL", "AccessKey", fallback="your-access-key")
    
    # Choose the endpoint depending on VPC flag
    endpoint = vpc_endpoint if use_vpc else public_endpoint
    
    # Prepare the request payload
    payload = {
        "video_url": video_url,
        "instruction": instruction,
    }

    # Set the Authorization header with the access key.
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    try:
        # Send a POST request to the model's API over HTTPS
        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)

        # Handle the response and return the description from the AI model
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            return result.get("description", "No description available.")
        else:
            logging.error(f"API Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
            return None

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to connect to the API: {e}")
        return None
```

# **What The Query is Currently Asking**

The function sends a request to the Qwen2-VL model with two important pieces of information:

1) **`video_url`**: The location of the video file that the AI should analyze.
2) **`instruction`**: The command or phrase that tells the AI what to do with the video. Currently, the default instruction is `"Describe this video."`

* **Current Behavior**:
  * The AI analyzes the video located at `video_url` based on the provided `instruction` and replies with a description or analysis directly related to the input query.
  * The output is typically a textual description of what's happening in the given video.

# 2. **Linking `priority_keywords.json` To the AI Query with Qwen2-VL**

# **Importance Of Linking**

To make sure that the AI model focuses on specific keywords or phrases (as defined in `priority_keywords.json`), we must modify the `query_qwen_vl_chat()` function to include these priority keywords in the `instruction` sent to the model.

# **Updating The AI Query**

# Step 1: Load `priority_keywords.json`

You would need to load the priority keywords from the JSON file.

```python
def load_priority_keywords(file_path):
    """Loads the priority keywords from a JSON file."""
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        logging.warning(f"Priority keywords file {file_path} not found.")
        return []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file).get("priority_keywords", [])
```

# Step 2: Integrate Priority Keywords into the Query

Modify `query_qwen_vl_chat()` to append these keywords to the instruction:

```python
def query_qwen_vl_chat(video_url, instruction="Describe this video.", use_vpc=False):
    """
    Sends a request to the Qwen-VL-Chat model API over HTTPS to process a video

    Args:
        video_url (str): The URL of the video file.
        instruction (str): The instruction or query to be passed to the AI model.
        use_vpc (bool): Whether to use the VPC endpoint instead of the public one.

    Returns:
        str: The model's response, typically a description or analysis of the video.    
    """
    # Load any priority keywords from priority_keywords.json
    priority_keywords = load_priority_keywords("priority_keywords.json")
    
    # If there are any priority keywords, append them to the instruction
    if priority_keywords:
        instruction += " Prioritize these keywords: " + ", ".join(priority_keywords)
        
    # Load from config with fallbacks
    public_endpoint = config.get("QwenVL", "PublicEndpoint", fallback="https://your-public-endpoint")
    vpc_endpoint = config.get("QwenVL", "VpcEndpoint", fallback="https://your-vpc-endpoint")
   _key = config.get("QwenVL", "AccessKey", fallback="your-access-key")
    
    # Choose the endpoint depending on VPC flag
    endpoint = vpc_endpoint if use_vpc else public_endpoint
    
    # Assemble the request payload
    payload = {
        "video_url": video_url,
        "instruction": instruction,
    }

    # Set the Authorization header with the access key
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    try:
        # Send POST request
        response = requests.post(endpoint json=payload, headers=headers)

        # Handle response
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            return result.get("description", "No description available.")
        else:
            logging.error(f"API Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
            return None

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to connect to the API: {e}")
        return None
```

**Behavior After the Update**:
* If a `priority_keywords.json` file is provided, your AI query will append these keywords to the instruction sent to the Qwen2-VL model.
* For example, if the priority keyword is "action sequence," the modified instruction might be: `"Describe this video. Prioritize these keywords: action sequence."`
* The AI model will then focus on detecting "action sequence" in its analysis and description.

# 3. **Why This Integration is Important**

* **Manual Guidance**: By adjusting the instruction with priority keywords, you have more control over the content generated by the AI model.
* **Focused Output**: Ensuring the priority keywords are considered increases the relevance of the AI-generated content to your specific goals (e.g., emphasizing particular actions, objects, themes in the video).

# Recap
* **Current Query**: Located in `query_qwen_vl_chat()` within `core.py`, currently asking the AI model to "Describe this video."
* **Linking Priority Keywords**: By integrating `priority_keywords.json`, the query will incorporate these pre-defined terms into the AI model's instruction to yield more focused, relevant descriptions.
* **Update**: Modify `query_qwen_vl_chat()` to load priority keywords and append them to the instruction sent to the AI model.

So, if you want this prioritized keyword focus, you should go ahead with implementing the `priority_keywords.json` integration as described. If you feel this step is unnecessary or redundant to your project's goals, you may opt to focus solely on the custom tagging via `custom_tags.json`.

I hope this clarifies how the query function connects, and how you can guide AI outputs using priority keywords! Let me know if you'd like any further assistance with this.

## YOU

What if there are words in the priority keywords the model does not understand or cannot interpret accurately? Does it not use them? Can we force it to learn a keyword = "new action" this way with repetition?

## BMO

You're asking an important and nuanced question regarding the behavior of AI models like Qwen2-VL when they encounter unfamiliar or niche keywords in the `priority_keywords.json` file. Let's discuss how the model handles unfamiliar terms, the implications of trying to "force" the AI model to interpret these terms, and strategies for training or fine-tuning the model to understand new keywords.

# 1. **What Happens If the Model Does Not Understand a Keyword?**

# **How AI Models Typically Handle Unfamiliar Terms**
* **No Direct Understanding**: AI models like Qwen2-VL rely on the data they've been trained on to understand and generate text. If the model encounters a keyword it's not familiar with (i.e., it's never seen this word or phrase during its training), it may:
  * Ignore the keyword entirely.
  * Attempt to interpret the word based on the closest match it knows.
  * Generate a vague or nonsensical response, especially if the keyword is highly specialized or invented.

* **Output Interpretation**: The model will still try to fulfill the query without that unfamiliar term, so you might see descriptions focused on other words that it does understand.

# **Implications For Your Pipeline**
* **Ineffectiveness**: If unfamiliar or new keywords are a key part of your `priority_keywords.json`, you might not get the enhanced AI-driven descriptions you expect—the model could fail to prioritize such terms.

# 2. **Can Repetition or Force-Feeding Help the Model Learn New Keywords?**

# **Repetition As a Strategy**
* **Repetition does not equal Learning**: Unlike human learning, where repetition can embed new concepts, repeating a term in AI queries won't "teach" the model that term. Models like Qwen2-VL are static in their knowledge based on the dataset they were originally trained on.
  * If you continually repeat the term "new action," the model might pick up on your intent it won't *learn* in the true sense, because the model's weights and parameters aren't changing through this usage.

# **Limitations Of Repetition**
* **No Memory or Adaptation**: These models don't have long-term memory or the ability to update their internal understanding just through repeated usage of terms in queries.
* **Context Derivation**: Repetition might help in generating more contextually-rich associations if the term has any meaningful components the model understands—but don't expect persistent learning across sessions.

# 3. **Legitimate Ways to Teach or Train the AI Model**

# **Option 1: Model Fine-Tuning**
* **What is Fine-Tuning?**
  * Fine-tuning involves training the model further using a specialized dataset that includes your new keywords or actions. This requires significant machine learning expertise and access to large datasets of video descriptions explicitly labeled with your keywords.

* **How It Works**:
  * You'd prepare a dataset rich in instances where the new action keyword or phrase is correctly associated with a specific video or image content.
  * Re-train the model on this dataset. The model adjusts its parameters to better recognize and describe content involving your new action keywords.

* **Pros/Cons**:
  * **Pros**: The model truly learns and understands the new terms and can apply them in new queries.
  * **Cons**: Resource-intensive (computational power, data acquisition, time), requires deep expertise, and you would need access to the model's training setup, which may not be feasible with pre-trained models like Qwen2-VL on some APIs.

# **Option 2: Prompt Engineering**
* **Enriching Context**: If fine-tuning is not an option, you could try improving how you phrase your `instruction` or manipulate context to make the model more likely to interpret unfamiliar terms correctly. For instance, pairing the new term with well-known terms or more detailed descriptions in `priority_keywords.json`.

* **Enhanced Descriptions**:
  * Build `priority_keywords.json` in a way where new terms are consistently associated with interpretable context. For example:

	```json
    {
        "priority_keywords": [
            "new action (a series of acrobatic moves)",
            "explosive sequence"
        ]
    }
    ```

  * The parentheses provide context that might help the model make closer guesses, although it may not be perfect or consistent.

# **Option 3: Post-Processing Adjustments**
* **Manual Review and Correction**: Automate or semi-automate a post-processing step where you review the AI's output and adjust it according to the specific niche terms that the AI failed to interpret correctly.

* **Augmentation**: You can merge AI-generated descriptions with known data about your "new action" to ensure consistency.

---

# Summary and Recommendation

* **Keyword Understanding**: The current AI model won't inherently understand or learn new terms from mere repetition, as it requires retraining or fine-tuning to genuinely "learn" new concepts.

* **Fine-Tuning**: Ideally, for a model to accurately handle unfamiliar terms, it would need to be fine-tuned on a dataset that includes those terms.

* **Workarounds**: In the absence of fine-tuning ability, consider enhancing your prompts (through prompt engineering) or handling ambiguous terms in a post-processing step.
* **Current Integration**: If you plan to keep `priority_keywords.json` and expect the model to focus on involved or niche terms, it's better to pair these with more familiar concepts in your prompts.

# Handling of Sensitive Keywords by AI Models

AI models like Q2-VL, which are trained by large companies (e.g., Alibaba for Qwen2-VL) often have various and content moderation mechanisms built into them to prevent misuse. This includes:

1) **Content Filtering**:
   * **Prohibited Content**: The model might be programmed to avoid processing, generating, or even acknowledging content that's associated with pornography, explicit sexual behavior, or other adult content.
   * **Safe Usage**: These filters are necessary to prevent the model from being used for creating or spreading inappropriate, unethical, or harmful content.

2) **Bias and Sensitivity**:
   * **Avoiding Explicit Content**: AI models are often deliberately biased to either ignore or produce sanitized versions of such content. This keeps their output appropriate for a general audience and helps prevent misuse.
   * **Lack of Robustness**: The model might not produce meaningful or accurate responses when prompted with explicit keywords and could return a generic, blank, or error response. It might outright reject or ignore prompts it perceives inappropriate.

3) **Terms of Service and Usage Policies**:
   * **Platform Limitations**: Most AI platforms, including those hosting models like Qwen2-VL, have strict terms of service that prevent the use of their models for generating or analyzing explicit content. Violating these terms can result in account suspensions or more severe actions.

# Specific Behavior with Pornographic or Explicit Keywords

# **If You Provide Pornographic Keywords in `priority_keywords.json`:**

1) **Could Be Ignored**:
   * The model might completely ignore these keywords and continue to generate generic content-related descriptions, depending on how it's been configured.

2) **Sanitized Outputs**:
   * If the model processes these keywords, it might generate a sanitized, neutral description that avoids explicit language, focusing on non-explicit aspects if possible.

3) **Rejection of Queries**:
   * Some AI models might reject queries if they detect terms associated with explicit behavior. This might result in an error message or a flagging of the content query by the API.

# Operational Impact

Given the context:

* **Ineffectiveness of Keywords**: Including highly explicit keywords or terms associated with adult content in `priority_keywords.json` is unlikely to be effective or useful. The model's output might not accurately reflect these keywords due to built-in content filtering mechanisms.

* **Content Moderation**: If your work involves explicit content (e.g., for content moderation or academic purposes), using models like Qwen2-VL that are intended for general use and likely include filters might not be the best fit. Specialized solutions that acknowledge and process explicit content might better suit such requirements, provided that they're used ethically and within the bounds of legal regulations.

# Alternative Considerations

1) **Use Specialized Solutions**:
   * If your task genuinely involves content tagging or analysis in sensitive areas, consider using other tools specifically designed for such purposes, possibly ones focusing on strict content moderation rather than general AI generation.

2) **Ethical Considerations**:
   * Always consider the ethical implications and legalities of working with adult content datasets. Public-facing AI platforms typically discourage or prohibit such usage.

3) **Exploring Manual Alternatives**:
   * You might need to layer additional content moderation techniques, possibly including human-in-the-loop methods or specialized image/video recognition tools to handle explicit content properly.

# Summary and Final Thoughts

* **Model Implementation**: The Qwen2-VL model and similar advanced AI tools are less likely to fully recognize or correctly process explicit adult-related terms due to content filtering mechanisms.

* **Recommendations**: Avoid relying on general AI models for work on explicit content and explore more specialized solutions if needed.
* **Ethical Use**: Ensure any tools or datasets you use in such sensitive areas are employed ethically and legally, abiding by any applicable laws, platform terms, and moral guidelines.

If your workflow involves these areas for legitimate professional reasons (like academia or content moderation), carefully choose platforms and tools that align with those goals. If you need further advice on working with AI in content moderation or related tasks, feel free to reach out!

## YOU

I am trying to identify, categorize and index for consumption, pornographic content that is legally created, distributed, and purchaseds.

## BMO

Thank you for providing additional context about your use case. Handling, categorizing, and indexing legally created pornographic content for lawful purposes can be a legitimate and complex task. However, it brings its own set of challenges due to the sensitive nature of the content and the ethical, legal, and technical considerations involved.

Below, I'll guide you through potential tools, best practices, ethical considerations, and possible approaches to achieve your objective.

# 1. **Ethical Considerations**


Before diving into the technical implementation, it's to emphasize the importance of ethical considerations:

. **Consent and Legality**:
	- Ensure that all content you work with is legally obtained and distributed. This includes verifying that the producers, distributors, and consumers have all complied applicable laws, including age verification and consent.


1) **Personal Data Protection**:
	* Handling sensitive content often involves dealing with personal data. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR (in Europe), CCPA (in California), or other local privacy laws.
	* Ensure that any identifying information about performers, producers, or consumers is handled with the utmost care, particularly when it comes to data storage, processing, and sharing.

2) **Stigmatization and Harm Reduction**:
	* Be mindful that the classification and categorization of such content should not perpetuate stigma or reinforce harmful stereotypes. Neutral, non-judgmental categorization allows for fair and respectful indexing and consumption.

# 2. **Technical Approach and Tools**

Given your goals, here are some possible approaches and tools you can use to identify, categorize, and index pornographic content for consumption:

# **B. Custom Models**


For more control and specificity, creating a custom machine learning model—a task performed with transfer learning—might be the most fitting approach:

1) **Custom NSFW Classification Model**:

	**Tools**:
	* **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch**: Leading frameworks for building custom deep learning models.
	* **Pre-Trained Models**: Begin with transfer learning from existing models like MobileNet, ResNet, or similar architectures pre-trained on general image datasets.
	* **Custom Dataset**: Fine-tune the model using a legally obtained and clearly labeled dataset that fits your specific use case.

	**How It Works**:
	* **Dataset Collection and Preparation**: First, collect a legally obtained dataset of pornographic and non-pornographic content. Label this dataset accurately into different categories.
	* **Training the Model**: Utilize transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained model to recognize and categorize the specific type of adult content you're working with. Train it to identify different forms of adult content based on features present in images or video frames.
	* **Deployment**: Incorporate this model into your indexing pipeline to categorize new content dynamically and accurately.

	**Challenges**:
	* Creating an accurately labeled dataset can be time-consuming, and careful attention is needed to ensure legal and ethical boundaries are respected.
	* Requires expertise in machine learning and access to high-performance computing resources for training.

# **C. Video Analysis and Frame Extraction**

1) **Frame Extraction with FFmpeg**:
 * Extract frames at regular intervals from videos (e.g., every 5 seconds) and run those frames through your NSFW detection model.
	* This method allows you to categorize videos based on the explicitness level found in the frames.
	* FFmpeg can be used to programmatically extract frames with timestamps, allowing the indexing to link directly to scenes within a video.

	**FFmpeg Command Example**:

	```bash
    ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf "fps=1/5" output_%04d.jpg
    ```

	* This extracts one frame per 5 seconds of video footage, saving them with filenames like `output_0001.jpg`, `output_0002.jpg`, etc.

# **D. Metadata and Content Indexing**

1) **Database Integration**:
	* **MongoDB or Postgres**:
		* the metadata (title, duration, categories, links to extracted, confidence scores) in a database.
		* Integrate full-text search capabilities to allow querying on various criteria, such as content category, confidence score, performer names, or other metadata.

2) **Search and Discovery**:
	* Implement a search engine or discovery tool that allows users to filter and sort content based on different criteria, aiding in consumption.
	* Elasticsearch could be used as a large-scale search engine indexing across your database to deliver real-time search results.

# 3. **Handling Related Challenges**

# **Content Categorization**

Categorizing adult content involves multiple non-judgmental and neutral categories such as:

* **By Genre**: Softcore, hardcore, BDSM, fetish, etc.
* **By Performer Attributes**: Categories by the number of performers, gender distribution, etc.
* **By Content Intensity**: Mild nudity versus explicit content.
* **By Production Type**: Professional production vs. amateur.

# **Legal Tools Usage**
* **Due Diligence**: Always ensure that tools comply with relevant laws where the content distributed or consumed.
* **Compliance**: Make sure the model's results are used in ways compliant with distribution laws, and categorized content is labeled according to legal mandates.

# 4. **Best Practices**

* **Transparency and Consent**: Ensure all persons involved in content creation have given explicit consent, and all legal protections surrounding age verification and content production were adhered to.
* **Respect for Privacy**: Safeguard any personal information associated with the content's creators and consumers.
* **Avoiding Exploitation**: Implement checks to ensure that no content involving non-consensual activity or illegal behavior is processed, indexed, distributed.

# 5. **Summary**

Given your goals, you can leverage what's available in the form of pre-trained models, custom NSFW detection, and metadata indexing solutions. Depending on your level of technical expertise, you might either adopt a ready-made solution via APIs or develop a fully customized solution using machine learning techniques.

This approach inherently respects legal and ethical considerations while also helping you achieve efficient and accurate categorization and indexing of legally distributed adult content.
