## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Basic Knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript**: Obsidian plugins are primarily written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Familiarity with these languages is essential.
- **Node.js and npm**: These are necessary for managing dependencies and running build scripts.
  - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Verify installation:
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
- **Code Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended due to its rich ecosystem and extensions.
- **Git**: For version control and interacting with repositories.
  - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - Verify installation:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
- **Obsidian Installed**: Ensure you have Obsidian installed and set up on your machine.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Step 1: Install the Obsidian Sample Plugin

Start by cloning the Obsidian Sample Plugin repository, which serves as an excellent starting point.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin.git
cd obsidian-sample-plugin
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Use npm to install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including the Obsidian API types.

### Step 3: Understanding the Project Structure

Key files and directories:

- **`main.ts`**: Entry point of your plugin.
- **`manifest.json`**: Contains metadata about your plugin.
- **`styles.css`**: Optional styles for your plugin's UI components.
- **`package.json`**: Manages dependencies and scripts.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration.

---

## Understanding Obsidian's Plugin Architecture

Obsidian plugins interact with the app through the [Obsidian API](https://publish.obsidian.md/api/). The API provides various hooks, methods, and interfaces to interact with the editor, files, UI components, and more.

### Key Concepts

- **Plugins vs. Community Plugins**: Plugins developed by the Obsidian team vs. those developed by the community. Community plugins require user activation.
- **Manifest File**: `manifest.json` defines the plugin's metadata, including name, version, author, and required API version.
- **Main Module**: The primary TypeScript file (`main.ts`) where the plugin's functionality is implemented by extending Obsidian's `Plugin` class.
- **Settings**: Plugins can have customizable settings, stored in a settings tab.

## Creating Your First Plugin

Let's walk through creating a simple "Hello World" plugin.

### Step 1: Modify `manifest.json`

Update the `manifest.json` with your plugin's details.

```json
{
  "id": "hello-world-plugin",
  "name": "Hello World Plugin",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "minAppVersion": "0.12.0",
  "description": "A simple Hello World plugin for Obsidian.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "authorUrl": "https://yourwebsite.com",
  "isDesktopOnly": false
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Plugin Logic in `main.ts`

Replace the contents of `main.ts` with the following:

```typescript
import { App, Plugin, Notice } from 'obsidian';

export default class HelloWorldPlugin extends Plugin {
    async onload() {
        console.log('Hello World Plugin loaded');

        this.addCommand({
            id: 'say-hello',
            name: 'Say Hello',
            callback: () => {
                new Notice('Hello, Obsidian!');
            },
        });
    }

    onunload() {
        console.log('Hello World Plugin unloaded');
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Build the Plugin

Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the `main.js` file, which Obsidian uses.

## Testing and Debugging Your Plugin

### Testing

1. **Enable Developer Mode in Obsidian**:
   - Open Obsidian.
   - Go to **Settings** > **Community Plugins**.
   - Disable **Safe mode**.
   - Click on **Browse** and then **Load unpacked plugin**.
   - Select the directory of your plugin.

2. **Reload Obsidian**:
   - After loading, you should see your plugin listed under **Installed Plugins**. Enable it.

3. **Test the Plugin**:
   - Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
   - Type "Say Hello" and select the command.
   - A notice saying "Hello, Obsidian!" should appear.

### Debugging

- **Use `console.log`**: Output messages to Obsidian's developer console to track plugin behavior.
- **Access the Developer Console**:
  - Open Obsidian.
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on macOS) to open the developer tools.
  - Navigate to the **Console** tab to view logs and errors.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure you handle potential errors gracefully to prevent plugin crashes.

```typescript
try {
    // Your code
} catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
}
```

## Publishing Your Plugin

### Step 1: Prepare Your Plugin

- Ensure your `manifest.json` is accurate.
- Increment the version number appropriately.
- Include a `README.md` with detailed instructions and documentation.
- Optionally, add screenshots or GIFs demonstrating your plugin.

### Step 2: Fork the Community Plugins Repository

Obsidian manages community plugins through their [Community Plugins](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) repository.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new directory for your plugin under the `plugins` folder.
3. Add your plugin's repository URL in the appropriate JSON file (refer to the repository's contribution guidelines).

### Step 3: Submit a Pull Request

1. Follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the repository.
2. Ensure your plugin meets all requirements, such as proper metadata and no sensitive information.
3. Submit a pull request for review.

### Step 4: Await Approval

The Obsidian team or community moderators will review your plugin. They may request changes or approve it for inclusion.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plugin Not Loading**:
   - Ensure the `manifest.json` is correctly configured.
   - Check for errors in the developer console.

2. **Commands Not Appearing**:
   - Verify the command is registered in the `onload` method.
   - Check for typos in the command ID or name.

3. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed.
   - Check the `tsconfig.json` for correct TypeScript settings.

### Tips

- Regularly check the [Obsidian API Documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/api/) for updates.
- Use the [Obsidian Plugin Development Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/plugins/12) for community support.
