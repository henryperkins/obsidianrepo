**user**: [logger.py](logger.py.md) [Logger changes](Logger%20changes.md)
[Timestamp: 2024/12/07 13:50:07]

**ai**: It seems you are already aware of the updates from the existing `logger.py` file to the newer version, as highlighted in the `Logger changes` note. The main changes you've noted include:

1. `LoggerSetup` is now a singleton.
2. `get_logger` is cached using `lru_cache`.
3. Logging methods are now class methods of `LoggerSetup`.
4. Added module-level logging functions for convenience.
5. Explicit shutdown of loggers via a `shutdown` method.

To adapt your codebase:

### Getting Loggers

Continue using the previous approach to get loggers. Internal mechanisms such as singleton pattern and caching are now handled by the `LoggerSetup` class.

### Using Logging Methods

You have two options:
- **Use module-level functions for convenience:**
  ```python
  from core.logger import log_error, log_debug, log_info, log_warning
  
  log_error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)
  ```
- **Use `LoggerSetup` class methods if finer control is required:**
  ```python
  from core.logger import LoggerSetup
  
  LoggerSetup.log_error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)
  ```

### Configuration

No change in how you configure the logger globally.

### Exception Handling

Ensure exception handling uses the class method:
```python
sys.excepthook = LoggerSetup.handle_exception
```

### Shutdown

Make sure to call `LoggerSetup.shutdown()` in your main script or exit points to cleanly close file handlers:
```python
try:
    # Your main application logic
    ...
finally:
    LoggerSetup.shutdown()
```

By following these changes consistently, your codebase will fully leverage the enhancements in the updated `logger.py`. The use of `__all__` allows for flexible imports, so using module-level functions can make your logging calls more streamlined.
