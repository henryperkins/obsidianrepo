# Updates to Docs

## How to Ensure Comprehensive Markdown Documentation

To ensure that the generated markdown documentation is comprehensive, consider the following strategies:

1. **Thorough Docstring Extraction üìù**  
   Ensure that all docstrings are extracted and processed from the source code. The `core/code_extraction.py` file contains the logic for extracting classes, functions, and their respective docstrings. This ensures that all documented elements are included in the generated markdown.

2. **Detailed Docstring Parsing üîç**  
   Use the `core/docstring_processor.py` to parse and format docstrings. This module ensures that the docstrings are converted into a structured format, which can then be used to generate detailed markdown documentation.

3. **Comprehensive Section Generation üìÑ**  
   The `docs/markdown_generator.py` file is responsible for generating markdown documentation. Ensure that all sections, including module overviews, class descriptions, and function details, are included. This will provide a complete overview of the codebase.

4. **Validation and Error Handling ‚úÖ**  
   Implement validation checks using the `core/docstring_processor.py` to ensure that the docstrings meet the required standards. Handle any errors or missing information gracefully to avoid incomplete documentation.

5. **Include Source Code Snippets üîß**  
   Optionally, include source code snippets in the markdown documentation. This can be configured in the `MarkdownConfig` class in `docs/markdown_generator.py` by setting `include_source` to True. This helps provide context to the documentation.

6. **Monitor and Track Metrics üìä**  
   Utilize the `core/monitoring.py` to collect and analyze metrics related to the documentation generation process. This helps identify any areas of improvement and ensures the documentation process is efficient and comprehensive.

## How to Ensure Accurate AI-Generated Docstrings

To ensure the AI-generated docstrings are accurate, consider the following strategies:

1. **Docstring Validation ‚úÖ**  
   Use the `core/docstring_processor.py` to validate the generated docstrings. This module ensures that the docstrings meet the required standards and are comprehensive.

2. **Docstring Generation üìù**  
   Utilize the `AIInteractionHandler` class in `ai_interaction.py` to generate detailed and structured docstrings. This class interacts with the Azure OpenAI API to create accurate docstrings.

3. **Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è**  
   Implement error handling for missing or incomplete docstrings in the `core/docstring_processor.py`. This ensures that any issues with docstrings are gracefully handled and reported.

4. **Monitoring and Metrics üìä**  
   Use the `core/monitoring.py` to track metrics related to docstring generation and validation. This helps identify areas of improvement and ensures the process is efficient.

5. **Cache Results üíæ**
