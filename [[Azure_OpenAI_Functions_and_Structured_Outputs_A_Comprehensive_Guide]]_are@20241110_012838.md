## Setup and Configuration

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

### Environment Configuration

```python
import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# Core configuration
endpoint = os.getenv("ENDPOINT_URL", "https://openai-eastus2-hp.openai.azure.com/")
deployment = os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT_NAME", "gpt-4o-400ktpm")
subscription_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize Azure OpenAI client
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_key=subscription_key,
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
)
```

## Core Components

### Basic Chat Completion

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=deployment,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}],
    temperature=0.13,
    max_tokens=16384,
    top_p=0.95
)
```

## Implementation Examples

### Complete Integration Example

```python
async def process_interaction():
    # Speech recognition
    print("Listening...")
    speech_result = speech_recognizer.recognize_once_async().get()
    
    # Process with Azure OpenAI
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=deployment,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": speech_result.text}],
        temperature=0.13,
        max_tokens=16384
    )
    
    # Text-to-speech output
    response_text = completion.choices[0].message.content
    speech_synthesizer.speak_text(response_text)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement specific exception handling for API requests and responses.
   - Use logging and monitoring tools like Sentry to capture and analyze errors.

2. **Response Processing**
   - Use attribute checks (`hasattr`) to safely access nested attributes in API responses.
   - Validate structured outputs against predefined schemas to ensure data integrity.

3. **Resource Management**
   - Use `asyncio.Semaphore` to limit concurrent requests and manage resources efficiently.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **API Connection Issues**

   ```python
   # Verify connectivity
   try:
       response = client.chat.completions.create(
           model=deployment,
           messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Test"}]
       )
       print("Connection successful")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**

   ```python
   def exponential_backoff(attempt: int) -> float:
       return min(300, (2 ** attempt))  # Max 300 seconds
   ```

3. **Response Handling Errors**
   - Ensure correct access to response attributes using `hasattr`.
   - Handle missing or malformed data gracefully with fallback logic.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. API Connection Issues

**Problem:** Unable to connect to the Azure OpenAI API or Vercel AI SDK.

**Causes:**
- Incorrect API endpoint or key.
- Network connectivity issues.
- Firewall or security settings blocking the connection.

**Solutions:**
- Verify that the API endpoint and key are correct and have not expired.
- Test your network connection and ensure that your firewall allows outbound connections to the API endpoint.
- Use the following code snippet to test connectivity:

  ```python
  try:
      response = client.chat.completions.create(
          model="deployment-name",
          messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Test"}]
      )
      print("Connection successful")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
  ```

#### 2. Authentication Errors

**Problem:** Authentication fails when trying to access the API.

**Causes:**
- Invalid API key or token.
- Incorrect configuration of environment variables.

**Solutions:**
- Double-check the API key and ensure it matches the one provided in your Azure or Vercel account.
- Ensure that environment variables are correctly set and accessible in your application.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
  export AZURE_ENDPOINT="https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
  ```

#### 3. Rate Limiting

**Problem:** API requests are being throttled due to exceeding rate limits.

**Causes:**
- Too many requests sent in a short period.
- Exceeding the allocated quota for your subscription.

**Solutions:**
- Implement exponential backoff to retry requests after a delay:

  ```python
  import time

  def exponential_backoff(attempt: int) -> float:
      return min(300, (2 ** attempt))  # Max 300 seconds

  for attempt in range(5):
      try:
          # Make API call
          break
      except openai.error.RateLimitError:
          time.sleep(exponential_backoff(attempt))
  ```

- Monitor your usage and adjust your application to stay within limits.

#### 4. Unexpected API Responses

**Problem:** Receiving unexpected or malformed responses from the API.

**Causes:**
- Incorrect API request parameters.
- Changes in the API version or model behavior.

**Solutions:**
- Validate your request parameters and ensure they match the expected format.
- Check for any updates or changes in the API documentation that might affect your requests.
- Use logging to capture and analyze responses:

  ```python
  import logging

  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  try:
      response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
      logger.debug("API Response: %s", response)
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error("API Error: %s", e)
  ```

#### 5. Function Call Errors

**Problem:** Errors occur when calling functions within the AI model.

**Causes:**
- Incorrect function schema or parameters.
- Missing required fields in the function call.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure that the function schema is correctly defined and matches the expected structure.
- Validate that all required fields are included in the function call.
- Use the following template to define and call functions:

  ```python
  function_schema = {
      "name": "example_function",
      "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "param1": {"type": "string"}
          },
          "required": ["param1"]
      }
  }

  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="deployment-name",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Call example function"}],
      functions=[function_schema],
      function_call={"name": "example_function"}
  )
  ```

### Troubleshooting (Continued)

#### 6. Invalid Model or Deployment Name

**Problem:** The specified model or deployment name is not recognized by the API.

**Causes:**
- Typographical errors in the model or deployment name.
- The model or deployment has not been created or is not available in your subscription.

**Solutions:**
- Double-check the spelling and case sensitivity of the model and deployment names.
- Verify that the model or deployment is correctly set up in your Azure OpenAI account.
- Use the Azure portal or CLI to list available deployments and confirm their names.

#### 7. Data Serialization Issues

**Problem:** Errors occur when serializing or deserializing data for API requests or responses.

**Causes:**
- Incorrect data types or structures being used.
- JSON encoding/decoding errors.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure that data structures match the expected JSON format.
- Use Python's `json` module to handle serialization:

  ```python
  import json

  data = {"key": "value"}
  json_data = json.dumps(data)  # Serialize to JSON
  parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)  # Deserialize from JSON
  ```

- Validate data before sending it to the API to ensure it meets schema requirements.

#### 8. Timeout Errors

**Problem:** API requests are timing out, leading to incomplete operations.

**Causes:**
- Network latency or connectivity issues.
- Large payloads or complex operations exceeding time limits.

**Solutions:**
- Increase the timeout setting if supported by the API client.
- Optimize requests by reducing payload size or complexity.
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient network issues.

#### 9. Inconsistent Output Quality

**Problem:** The quality of AI-generated outputs varies significantly between requests.

**Causes:**
- Variability in model responses due to randomness.
- Inappropriate model parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens).

**Solutions:**
- Adjust model parameters to control output variability:

  ```python
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="deployment-name",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}],
      temperature=0.7,  # Lower temperature for more deterministic outputs
      max_tokens=150
  )
  ```

- Use prompt engineering techniques to guide the model towards desired outputs.

#### 10. Integration and Compatibility Issues

**Problem:** Issues arise when integrating Azure OpenAI with other systems or SDKs.

**Causes:**
- Version mismatches between libraries or SDKs.
- Incompatible configurations or dependencies.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all libraries and SDKs are up-to-date and compatible.
- Check the documentation for any known compatibility issues or required configurations.
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts:

  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
