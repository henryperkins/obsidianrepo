# [Prompts](Prompts.md)_format_these_prompts_better@20241117_225434

**user**: [Refining AI Prompts for Actionable Code Improvements](./Refining%20AI%20Prompts%20for%20Actionable%20Code%20Improvements.md) format these prompts better  
[Timestamp: 2024/11/17 22:54:34]

**ai**: To refine the prompts in the [Refining AI Prompts for Actionable Code Improvements](./Refining%20AI%20Prompts%20for%20Actionable%20Code%20Improvements.md) section and make them more actionable for the AI, we can focus on enhancing specificity, restrictiveness, and measurability. Hereâ€™s how each prompt can be improved:

## 4. Enhanced Prompt Engineering and Error-Driven Retrieval

**4.1. Error Checking and Missing Dependency Retrieval**
- **Original Prompt**: "Integrate an error-checking mechanism that parses generated code for undefined references..."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Develop an error-checking module that scans generated code for undefined references and function calls. When detected, automatically query the codebase to retrieve the missing code chunk and reprocess the prompt. Test this module with five scenarios where missing dependencies are intentionally introduced, ensuring successful retrieval and integration of each missing function."

**4.2. Dependency-based Prompt Adjustment**
- **Original Prompt**: "Create a prompt adjustment system that modifies the prompt structure based on detected dependencies..."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Implement a prompt adjustment system that dynamically modifies prompts based on detected dependencies using the `ChunkMetadata` structure. Prioritize including related classes and modules when functions have unresolved dependencies. Verify this by running tests where the model is queried with partial function definitions and confirming that the adjusted prompt consistently includes the correct dependent context."

**4.3. Feedback Loop for Iterative Retrieval**
- **Original Prompt**: "Build a feedback loop that monitors model responses for completeness..."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Create a feedback loop mechanism that monitors responses from the model. If the response contains placeholders for missing context (e.g., 'function X not found'), automatically retrieve the relevant code and re-query the model with the updated context. Test this loop using a series of incomplete prompts to ensure it successfully resolves each case in under three iterations."

## 5. Modular and Extensible Design for Compatibility with Any Language Model

**5.1. API Abstraction Layer**
- **Original Prompt**: "Design an abstraction layer that supports different language model APIs..."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Develop an API abstraction layer that supports both OpenAI and Hugging Face APIs. Standardize input and output formats, ensuring consistent results regardless of the underlying model. Validate the abstraction layer by integrating with both APIs and verifying identical responses for the same input context."

**5.2. Plugin System for Extensibility**
- **Original Prompt**: "Implement a plugin system that allows developers to add modules for specific programming languages..."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Implement a plugin system that supports hot-swappable modules for specific programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Configure plugins via a JSON file, enabling dynamic loading without restarting the main application. Test this system by creating and swapping at least two plugins, ensuring seamless operation without codebase changes."

**5.3. Configuration and User-defined Context Rules**
- **Original Prompt**: "Create a configuration interface that allows developers to define rules for context retention..."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Build a configuration module that allows developers to define rules for context retention and prioritization using YAML files. Enable dynamic reloading of these rules at runtime. Test the configuration system by defining three different rule sets (e.g., prioritize classes, minimize utility functions, and prioritize recent code) and ensuring correct application during context management."

## Summary of Refinement Criteria

1. **Specificity**: Each prompt specifies exact actions, expected outcomes, and involved files or modules.
2. **Restrictiveness**: Prompts include clear constraints and conditions, such as testing criteria or token limits, ensuring precise development steps.
3. **Measurable Outcomes**: Each prompt includes criteria for determining implementation success, such as the number of iterations or consistency checks.

By refining the prompts in this manner, the AI can effectively guide development, reduce ambiguity, and provide clear objectives, ensuring comprehensive coverage of each feature.
