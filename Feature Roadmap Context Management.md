Certainly! Based on the guidance provided in **`Current Focus.md`** and our updated **Implementation Plan**, here are the key features and guidance steps you need to **follow strictly** to succeed. By focusing on these critical aspects, you'll effectively develop your tool to keep the AI "in the loop" without constant manual review, even when context window limits are exceeded.

---

## **Key Features and Guidance Steps to Follow Strictly**

### **1. Implement Persistent Context Management**

**Objective:** Maintain essential context information across interactions so that the AI remains informed even when context window limits are exceeded.

#### **Actions:**

- **Create a `ContextManager` Class:**
  - Develop a class dedicated to storing and managing important context data persistently.
  - The `ContextManager` should handle adding, retrieving, and managing context entries.

- **Integrate `ContextManager` into Your Processing Pipeline:**
  - Update your main processing functions (e.g., `process_file` in `file_handlers.py`) to utilize the `ContextManager`.
  - Accumulate crucial context information extracted during code processing.

- **Add Critical Information to Context:**
  - Extract key information such as function signatures, class definitions, and important variables.
  - Store this information in the `ContextManager` for persistent availability.

---

### **2. Implement Dynamic Context Adaptation**

**Objective:** Allow the AI to request additional context or indicate when certain context is no longer needed, enabling adaptive context management based on AI responses.

#### **Actions:**

- **Define AI Signals in the Prompt:**
  - Establish specific tokens or messages that the AI can use to communicate context needs (e.g., `NEED_MORE_CONTEXT`, `REMOVE_CONTEXT:<context_reference>`).
  - Clearly instruct the AI within the prompt on how to request more context or indicate unnecessary context.

- **Modify API Interaction to Handle AI Feedback:**
  - Update functions like `fetch_documentation_rest` in `file_handlers.py` to detect these signals in the AI's responses.
  - Implement logic to adjust the context (add or remove entries) based on the AI's feedback.

- **Adjust Context Based on AI Feedback:**
  - Use the `ContextManager` to modify the context according to AI requests.
  - Ensure the AI receives the most relevant and up-to-date context.

---

### **3. Enhance Documentation Generation with NLP Integration**

**Objective:** Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy) to enrich the extracted code structure with additional meaningful context that can aid the AI.

#### **Actions:**

- **Integrate NLP Libraries into Code Analysis:**
  - Update your language handlers (e.g., `python_handler.py`) to perform NLP analysis on docstrings, comments, and code identifiers.
  - Extract entities, keywords, and summaries using spaCy.

- **Include NLP Analysis in Documentation:**
  - Modify your documentation generation functions (e.g., `write_documentation_report.py`) to include insights from the NLP analysis.
  - Present NLP-derived information in a structured format that the AI can utilize.

- **Provide Contextual Information to the AI:**
  - Incorporate the NLP-enhanced context into the prompts sent to the AI.
  - This richer context will improve the AI's understanding and responses.

---

### **4. Develop Context Management Features**

**Objective:** Handle the AI's context window limitations by effectively managing and optimizing the context passed to the AI.

#### **Actions:**

- **Implement Chunking Strategies:**
  - Break down large inputs into manageable chunks that fit within the AI's context window without losing essential meaning.
  - Use tokenization and chunking utilities (e.g., `chunk_text` function in `utils.py`).

- **Implement Contextual Prioritization:**
  - Prioritize which information is most relevant and should be included in the context sent to the AI.
  - Use scoring functions to rank sections based on relevance to the current task.

- **Implement Dynamic Context Adjustment:**
  - Adjust the context based on the AI's responses or the application's state.
  - Adaptively manage context size and content to stay within limitations while providing maximum utility.

---

### **5. Design Context-Aware Prompt Engineering**

**Objective:** Craft prompts that effectively use the provided context and guide the AI to produce accurate and relevant outputs.

#### **Actions:**

- **Modify Prompt Generation to Include Context:**
  - Update your prompt construction functions (e.g., `generate_documentation_prompt` in `write_documentation_report.py`) to include the persistent context from the `ContextManager`.
  - Clearly separate context from instructions using markers (e.g., `[Context Start]` and `[Context End]`).

- **Provide Clear Instructions to the AI:**
  - Guide the AI on how to utilize the provided context within the prompt.
  - Explain how the AI should request additional context or indicate obsolete context.

- **Fine-tune Prompt Content:**
  - Ensure the prompt is concise and focuses on the most critical information.
  - Use summarization where necessary to stay within the context window limits.

---

### **6. (Optional but Beneficial) Implement Embedding-Based Context Retrieval**

**Objective:** Use embeddings to represent context data and perform similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant context based on the AI's current needs.

#### **Actions:**

- **Generate Embeddings for Context Entries:**
  - Use embedding models (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`) to create vector representations of context entries.
  - Store embeddings along with metadata for retrieval.

- **Set Up a Vector Store for Efficient Retrieval:**
  - Implement a vector database or in-memory store to hold embeddings.
  - Use libraries like Faiss for efficient similarity search.

- **Retrieve Relevant Context Using Similarity Search:**
  - Implement functions to compare AI queries or current context with stored embeddings.
  - Fetch and provide the most relevant context entries to the AI.

---

### **7. Optimize Context Content**

**Objective:** Ensure that the most critical information is included within the AI's context window by prioritizing and compressing context data.

#### **Actions:**

- **Implement Context Prioritization:**
  - Score and sort context entries based on their relevance to the current task or AI query.
  - Use domain-specific factors to determine importance.

- **Implement Summarization Techniques:**
  - Use summarization algorithms to condense less critical context entries.
  - Ensure essential information is retained while reducing context size.

- **Compress Context Data:**
  - Apply text compression strategies to include more information within the context window.

---

### **8. Enhance Code Formatting and Documentation**

**Objective:** Prepare the codebase for optimal integration by ensuring consistent code formatting and comprehensive documentation.

#### **Actions:**

- **Integrate Code Formatters and Linters:**
  - Use language-specific formatters (e.g., Black for Python, Prettier for JavaScript) to enforce consistent code styling.
  - Incorporate formatting into your script's processing pipeline.

- **Enhance Docstring Content:**
  - Update the documentation generation to create detailed docstrings, including parameter descriptions, return types, and examples.
  - Ensure docstrings follow a consistent style guide (e.g., Google Python Style Guide).

- **Perform Syntax Validation and Linting:**
  - Utilize syntax validators and linters to ensure code correctness and adherence to best practices.
  - Integrate validation into the `validate_code` methods of each handler.

- Store important context data persistently.
- Handle adding, retrieving, and managing context entries.
- Provide methods to interact with the context data (e.g., add, get, remove).

### **1.1 Implement `context_manager.py`**

```python
# context_manager.py

import threading
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

class ContextManager:
    """
    Manages persistent context information for AI interactions.
    """

    def __init__(self, max_entries: int = 100):
        self.max_entries = max_entries
        self.context_entries = deque(maxlen=self.max_entries)
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def add_context(self, context_entry: str):
        """
        Adds a new context entry to the context manager.

        Args:
            context_entry (str): The context information to add.
        """
        with self.lock:
            self.context_entries.append(context_entry)

    def get_context(self) -> List[str]:
        """
        Retrieves all current context entries.

        Returns:
            List[str]: A list of context entries.
        """
        with self.lock:
            return list(self.context_entries)

    def clear_context(self):
        """
        Clears all context entries.
        """
        with self.lock:
            self.context_entries.clear()

    def remove_context(self, context_reference: str):
        """
        Removes context entries that contain the specified reference.

        Args:
            context_reference (str): Reference string to identify context entries to remove.
        """
        with self.lock:
            self.context_entries = deque(
                [entry for entry in self.context_entries if context_reference not in entry],
                maxlen=self.max_entries
            )

    def get_relevant_context(self, query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> List[str]:
        """
        Retrieves the most relevant context entries based on the query.

        Args:
            query (str): The query to match against context entries.
            top_k (int): Number of top relevant entries to return.

        Returns:
            List[str]: A list of relevant context entries.
        """
        # For simplicity, we'll do a simple keyword matching.
        # This can be replaced with a more sophisticated method using embeddings.
        with self.lock:
            matched_entries = [entry for entry in self.context_entries if query.lower() in entry.lower()]
            return matched_entries[:top_k]
```

---

## **2. Integrate `ContextManager` into Your Processing Pipeline**

We'll integrate the `ContextManager` into your main processing functions, specifically `process_file` in `file_handlers.py`, to accumulate crucial context information extracted during code processing.

### **2.1 Modify `file_handlers.py`**

**Import the `ContextManager` and Initialize It**

At the top of `file_handlers.py`, import the `ContextManager`:

```python
# file_handlers.py

import os
import shutil
import logging
import aiofiles
import aiohttp
import json
import asyncio
from typing import Set, List, Dict, Any, Optional

    is_binary,
    get_language,
    is_valid_extension,
    clean_unused_imports_async,
    format_with_black_async,
    run_flake8_async
)
from write_documentation_report import (
    generate_documentation_prompt,
    write_documentation_report,
    sanitize_filename,
    generate_table_of_contents
)
from context_manager import ContextManager  # Import ContextManager

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Initialize the ContextManager
context_manager = ContextManager(max_entries=100)
```

**Modify `process_file` to Use the `ContextManager`**

We'll update the `process_file` function to extract critical information and add it to the `ContextManager`.

            code_structure = await extract_code_structure(content, file_path, language, handler)
            if not code_structure:
                logger.warning(f"Could not extract code structure from '{file_path}'")

    Returns:
        str: A formatted string containing critical context information.
    """
    info_lines = [f"File: {file_path}"]
    # Extract function signatures
    functions = code_structure.get('functions', [])
    for func in functions:
        signature = f"def {func.get('name')}({', '.join(func.get('args', []))}):"
        doc = func.get('docstring', '').split('\n')[0]

## **3. Add Critical Information to Context**

As shown in the `extract_critical_info` function above, we're extracting:

- **Function Signatures and Brief Docs**
- **Class Definitions and Brief Docs**
- **Method Signatures within Classes**
- **Important Variables with Types and Descriptions**

This information is formatted as strings and added to the `ContextManager` for persistent availability.

---
## **5. Notes and Considerations**

- **Thread Safety:**

  - The `ContextManager` uses a lock (`threading.Lock()`) to ensure thread safety when accessed from multiple coroutines.
  - Since `asyncio` uses an event loop and coroutines, you might consider using `asyncio.Lock()` instead for true async operations.

- **Context Size Management:**

  - The `max_entries` parameter limits the number of context entries stored.
  - Tune this parameter based on your application's needs and the AI model's context window size.

- **Resetting Context:**

  - You may need to clear the context at certain points (e.g., after processing a batch of files).
  - Use `context_manager.clear_context()` as needed.

- **Future Enhancements:**

  - **Embeddings and Relevance Ranking:**
    - Implement `get_relevant_context` using embeddings for smarter context retrieval.
    - Currently, it uses simple keyword matching for demonstration.

  - **Dynamic Context Adaptation:**
    - Integrate AI feedback mechanisms as per your larger implementation plan.
    - Update the `ContextManager` accordingly.

## **6. Conclusion**

The `ContextManager` class provides a foundation for managing persistent context information, keeping the AI "in the loop" throughout the processing of multiple files. By integrating it into your `process_file` function and extracting critical information to store, you enhance the AI's ability to access and utilize relevant context.

Feel free to adjust the implementation to better suit your specific requirements, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance or clarification on any part of the code.

**Note:** Remember to update any import statements and ensure all modules are correctly referenced. Also, consider adding unit tests for the `ContextManager` and the modified functions to validate their behavior.

# Relative Ideas, Integrations and Features Relevant to AI Context Management. These need to be implemented into the script if they aren't already

Several types of data and factors can be used to help predict when an AI model will need to be refed information. These data points not only involve the **context window size** but also the **structure of the task**, the **complexity of the code**, and other aspects of the workflow that impact how efficiently the model can generate output within its token limits. Below are key factors and types of data that can help predict when refeeding will be needed:

### **1. Token Consumption Data**
   - **Token Count Per Line**: The average token count per line of code, sentence in text, or data element being processed helps you estimate how quickly the model will consume the available context window. Tracking the token count dynamically during generation is crucial to predicting when the window will reach its limit.
     - **Real-time Token Monitoring**: By tracking the real-time token count during code generation or text output, you can project how many more tokens the model can process before refeeding is needed.
     - **Average Token Length of Past Interactions**: You can analyze past code or text generation tasks to determine the typical token consumption pattern, which helps estimate future token requirements.

### **2. Complexity of the Code or Task**
   - **Code Complexity**: The more complex the code being generated, the more tokens it typically requires. For example, complex logic with nested functions, multiple variables, or recursive structures uses more tokens per line than simple, linear code.
     - **Data Points**: Complexity metrics like **cyclomatic complexity** or the **depth of nested structures** can be calculated beforehand to predict how much token space will be needed.
     - **Effect on Refeeding**: More complex code may require additional context or reference to earlier parts of the code, leading to faster consumption of the context window.
   - **External Dependencies**: If the code has external dependencies like imports, libraries, or API calls, it increases the token count because the model needs to maintain those references in its context.

### **3. Length and Structure of Inputs**
   - **Input Size**: The size of the input provided to the model can affect how quickly the context window is consumed. For instance, longer prompts, detailed explanations, or lengthy function signatures in the initial input will leave less room for code generation within the current context.
     - **Data Points**: Analyzing the length and structure of the prompt (number of tokens in the input prompt) can provide early signals for how soon the model may need to be refed.
   - **Input Types**: More detailed or complex inputs, such as prompts with many variables, functions, or descriptions, may reduce the available room for output within the current context.

### **4. Context Sensitivity of the Task**
   - **Cross-Dependencies**: Tasks that have high cross-dependencies—such as those where many components (e.g., functions, classes) are dependent on each other—require the model to retain more context. The more interrelated the parts are, the sooner the model will need refeeding to avoid losing track of key context.
     - **Data Points**: Analyzing how frequently functions or variables are referenced across the code can help estimate how quickly context is consumed.
   - **Referential Integrity**: If the task requires maintaining state or keeping track of references across multiple parts of the code or document, more context will be required to ensure coherence, thus necessitating more frequent refeeding.

### **5. Task Size and Scope**
   - **Task Granularity**: Larger tasks, such as generating entire files or modules, are more likely to exceed the context window limit compared to smaller tasks like generating a single function or snippet.
     - **Data Points**: Tracking the size of the task at the outset, such as the estimated number of functions, classes, or lines of code, can help predict how soon the model will hit the token limit and need refeeding.
   - **Scope of Output**: If the task involves generating a complete feature or module, the model might need refeeding sooner because it has to keep track of multiple interrelated parts of the code.

### **6. Token-Usage Pattern**
   - **Repeated Tokens**: Some parts of the output, like repeated variables, constants, or functions, may consume fewer tokens when reused multiple times, compared to new or more complex code being generated continuously.
     - **Data Points**: Monitoring the frequency of repeated code structures or variable names can indicate slower token consumption, allowing the model to generate more output before needing refeeding.
   - **New Definitions vs. Reuse**: When the model is defining new functions, classes, or variables, it consumes tokens more rapidly than when reusing existing structures. Thus, tasks involving many new definitions require more frequent refeeding.

### **7. Code Interactions and Dependencies**
   - **Interaction with External Code**: If the code being generated relies on external libraries or APIs, it might require more tokens to maintain references and understand how the external components fit into the context.
     - **Data Points**: Tracking the number of imports, API calls, or library dependencies within the code can help predict when refeeding is necessary.
   - **Cross-File References**: In projects with multiple files, where code generation depends on understanding variables or functions defined in other files, maintaining cross-file context will quickly consume tokens. This requires careful refeeding strategies to maintain coherence across files.

### **8. Length of Pre-existing Code**
   - **Existing Codebase Size**: If you are continuing work on an existing large codebase, the context window will be partially filled by the existing code, reducing the available space for new code generation.
     - **Data Points**: The number of lines or tokens in the pre-existing code that the model must keep in memory can be tracked to predict when new information will need to be refed.

### **9. Model-Specific Context Limits**
   - **Model Size and Configuration**: Different AI models have different context window sizes. For example, GPT-3 has a 4,096-token context window, while GPT-4’s 32K version has a much larger 32,768-token context window. Knowing the model’s limits upfront helps plan when refeeding will be required.
     - **Data Points**: Understanding the model's architecture and token limitations allows developers to set thresholds for when to start refeeding based on the number of tokens consumed.

### **10. Feedback from Generated Output**
   - **Output Feedback**: Analyzing the generated output for errors, missing references, or breaks in logic can signal that the model is losing context and that refeeding is needed.
     - **Data Points**: Monitoring the coherence of the output, particularly when the model starts producing inconsistent or incomplete code, is a direct signal that the context has been exceeded or lost.

### **11. Language-Specific Token Requirements**
   - **Programming Language**: Some languages tend to have longer lines or more verbose syntax (e.g., Java) compared to others (e.g., Python). More verbose languages will consume tokens faster.
     - **Data Points**: Analyzing the average number of tokens required per line in different languages can help predict how quickly the model will reach the context window limit.

### **12. Code Structure (Documentation, Comments, etc.)**
   - **Comments and Documentation**: Generating or maintaining inline comments and documentation alongside the code can add to token consumption. If documentation is interspersed within the code, the model will use more tokens, reducing the effective size of the code that can be processed.
     - **Data Points**: Tracking how much of the context window is consumed by non-code elements (like comments, docstrings, etc.) helps predict when code generation will need refeeding.

---

### **Using These Data Points to Predict Refeeding**
- **Dynamic Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring of token usage as the model generates code or text, using the token count and complexity metrics to predict when the model will need to be refed.
- **Pre-Task Estimation**: Before starting the task, estimate the total number of tokens needed based on the code's complexity, external dependencies, and task scope. Set thresholds for when to break tasks into smaller chunks to prevent token overrun.
- **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window mechanism to retain the most relevant parts of the context while dropping older, less relevant context. This helps manage the refed information more effectively.

The highest amount of code that an AI can generate **correctly and completely** depends on several factors, including the complexity of the task, the model being used, the available context window, and the constraints of the programming environment. Here's a breakdown of these factors:

**Useful to know in this use case:**

### **1. Context Window Size**
   - **Current Limits**: Most AI models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, are limited by their context window, which typically ranges from 4,000 tokens to 32,000 tokens in the largest models available today. This translates to a limit of **about 500 to 4,000 lines of code** depending on the structure of the code and the programming language.
   - **Impact**: This limit affects how much the AI can "remember" in a single pass. For instance, if you're generating a large function or module, the AI can only generate or understand parts that fit within the available context window. Beyond that, the AI would either need additional information or separate passes.

### **2. Complexity of the Code**
   - **Simple Code (Utility Functions or Small Scripts)**: AI can easily generate **hundreds to thousands of lines** of simple, modular, or repetitive code. Tasks like generating CRUD applications, utility scripts, or functions are within the AI’s capacity, as the logic is often straightforward and doesn't require deep interdependencies.
   - **Complex Code (Large Systems, APIs, or Architectures)**: For complex projects with intricate logic, cross-dependencies, and architectural constraints, the AI is limited. It may generate parts of a system well but struggle to maintain coherence across a large, interconnected codebase without iterative refinement or human intervention. In these cases, generating more than a few hundred lines of correct, complex code without human guidance can be difficult.

### **3. Iterative Code Generation**
   - **Contextual Expansion**: While a single pass of the AI might be limited by the context window, one way to extend this is by iteratively generating parts of the code, re-feeding context back into the model. By breaking the code into smaller chunks (modules or components) and processing them iteratively, the AI can handle larger projects, but this often requires careful orchestration and verification.
   - **Human-Assisted Iteration**: In practice, combining AI code generation with human review and refinement allows for larger codebases to be built. For example, AI can generate functions, methods, or modules, and a developer can stitch them together, ensuring the entire project works cohesively.

### **4. Assisted Code Generation Tools**
   - **GitHub Copilot**: This AI-powered code generation tool can generate lines or even functions of code in real-time as developers write code in their IDEs. However, this is mostly designed for smaller snippets or individual functions rather than entire systems.
   - **Code Synthesis**: Other tools like Codex (from OpenAI) or tools integrated into platforms like Replit and Tabnine focus on generating code in chunks, but are still largely constrained by context window size, code complexity, and the programming task's scope.

### **5. Long-Term Vision and Code Completion**
   - **Limitations**: AI models, as of now, are good at generating code snippets and completing individual modules or functions when given clear instructions or well-defined input/output. However, generating **entire systems** or complex architectures from scratch that are "correct and complete" is still beyond the capabilities of AI without significant human input and design guidance.
   - **Correctness and Completeness**: AI often generates code that is correct syntactically, but logical correctness and completeness depend on the complexity of the system. AI-generated code often needs to be reviewed, debugged, and integrated into existing systems by human developers.
