**ai**: It seems like you've provided the same Python script twice. If you're looking to understand the functionality of this script or if you have specific questions about it, I can help with that. Here's a brief overview of what the script does:

## Overview of `api_interaction.py`

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - The script uses environment variables to configure API credentials and endpoints for different services like Azure, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
   - It loads these configurations using the `dotenv` library.

2. **API Credentials and Configuration**:
   - `APICredentials` and `EnvironmentConfig` classes manage API keys and endpoints.
   - The `EnvironmentConfig` class also validates the presence of necessary environment variables.

3. **Model Configuration**:
   - `ModelConfig` and `ModelHeaders` classes manage model-specific configurations such as token limits and supported features.

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - `APILimits` and `APIRateLimit` classes handle rate limiting for API requests.
   - `EnhancedAPIRateLimiter` manages rate limits for multiple services and includes retry logic for failed requests.

5. **Metrics Collection**:
   - `APICallMetrics` and `ServiceMetrics` classes collect and store metrics about API calls.
   - `APIMetricsCollector` handles the recording and exporting of these metrics.

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - `CodeAnalysisTool` provides functionality to analyze Python code, extracting information about classes, functions, and modules.
   - It uses the `ast` module to parse and analyze code.

7. **Azure OpenAI Client**:
   - `AzureOpenAIClient` is a client for interacting with Azure's OpenAI services.
   - It includes methods for creating completions and analyzing code with AI enhancements.

8. **API Client**:
   - `APIClient` is a higher-level client that uses the `AzureOpenAIClient` to make API requests and perform code analysis.

## Key Features

- **Environment Management**: Uses environment variables to manage API credentials and configurations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting and retry logic to handle API request limits.
- **Metrics Collection**: Collects and exports metrics related to API usage.
- **Code Analysis**: Provides tools for analyzing Python code structure and generating insights.

If you have specific questions or need further details about any part of the script, feel free to ask!

**ai**: To add the provided code to the `api_interaction.py` module, you need to ensure that the code is integrated correctly without causing any conflicts or errors. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you integrate the code:

1. **Ensure Dependencies**: Make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed. This includes packages like `dotenv`, `openai`, and any custom modules like `core.logger`, `extract.code`, `extract.classes`, and `extract.functions`.
2. **Organize Imports**: Ensure that all imports are at the top of the file and are organized. This helps in maintaining readability and managing dependencies.
3. **Integrate Classes and Functions**: Add the classes and functions from the provided code into the `api_interaction.py` module. Ensure that they are placed logically within the module, maintaining the structure and flow of the code.
4. **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure there are no naming conflicts with existing classes, functions, or variables in the module. If there are, consider renaming them to avoid issues.
5. **Test the Integration**: After adding the code, thoroughly test the module to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that there are no runtime errors.

Here is how you can integrate the code into the `api_interaction.py` module:

```python
# Ensure all imports are at the top
import os
import ast
import json
import asyncio
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional, List, Union, Literal, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from collections import defaultdict
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from core.logger import LoggerSetup
from extract.code import extract_classes_and_functions_from_ast
from extract.classes import ClassExtractor
from extract.functions import FunctionExtractor
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Add the provided classes and functions here
# Ensure they are placed logically within the module

@dataclass
class APICredentials:
    api_key: str
    endpoint: Optional[str] = None
    org_id: Optional[str] = None
    deployment_name: Optional[str] = None

# ... (rest of the provided code)

# Ensure all classes and functions are added
# Test the module to ensure everything works correctly
```

## Testing

After integrating the code, perform the following tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each class and function to ensure they behave as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the module as a whole to ensure that all components work together seamlessly.
- **Environment Tests**: Test with different environment configurations to ensure that the module handles them correctly.

If you encounter any specific issues during integration, feel free to ask for further assistance!

**ai**: The `simple_extract/io/api_interaction.py` script is a simplified version of an API client that uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:

## Components

1. **Imports**:
   - `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for asynchronous HTTP requests.
   - `Dict` and `Any` from `typing` for type annotations.
   - `Config` and `Monitor` from the `core` module for configuration management and monitoring.
   - `get_logger` from the `logger` module for logging.

2. **Logger**:
   - A logger is initialized for the module using `get_logger`.

3. **APIClient Class**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The `APIClient` class initializes with configuration and monitoring objects.
     - It retrieves the base URL and API key from the configuration.
   - **make_request Method**:
     - This method performs an API request to a specified endpoint.
     - It supports different HTTP methods (default is `GET`) and can send JSON data.
     - The method uses `aiohttp.ClientSession` to manage HTTP sessions and requests.
     - It includes error handling for `aiohttp.ClientError` to log and raise exceptions.
     - The request is wrapped in a monitoring context to track the operation.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Requests**: Utilizes `aiohttp` for non-blocking HTTP requests, which is useful for high-performance applications.
- **Configuration Management**: Uses a `Config` class to manage API base URL and API key, allowing for easy configuration changes.
- **Monitoring**: Integrates a `Monitor` class to track API request operations, which can be useful for performance monitoring and debugging.
- **Error Handling**: Implements basic error handling to log and raise exceptions for failed API requests.

## Usage Example

To use this `APIClient`, you would typically instantiate it and call the `make_request` method with the desired endpoint and parameters:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = APIClient()
    try:
        response = await client.make_request('some/endpoint', method='POST', data={'key': 'value'})
        print(response)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates how to make a POST request to a specific endpoint with JSON data, handling any exceptions that might occur.
