It includes a class `AzureOpenAIIntegration` that manages these components and processes requests with optional caching and content filtering.

```python
class AzureOpenAIIntegration:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.client = client
        self.cache = ResponseCache(config["redis_url"])
        self.monitor = SystemMonitor()
        self.content_filter = ContentFilter(self.client)
        
    async def process_request(self, 
                            prompt: str,
                            use_cache: bool = True,
                            check_content: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        start_time = time.time()
        
        try:
            # Content filtering
            if check_content:
                content_check = await self.content_filter.check_content(prompt)
                if not content_check["safe"]:
                    raise ValueError(f"Content filtered: {content_check['reason']}")
            
            # Check cache
            if use_cache:
                cached_response = await self.cache.get_cached_response(
                    prompt, "gpt-4"
                )
                if cached_response:
                    return {
                        "response": cached_response,
                        "cached": True,
                        "processing_time": time.time() - start_time
                    }
            
            # Generate response
            response = await self.client.chat.completions.acreate(
                model="gpt-4",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            )
            
            response_text = response.choices[0].message.content
            
            # Cache response
            if use_cache:
                await self.cache.cache_response(prompt, "gpt-4", response_text)
            
            return {
                "response": response_text,
                "cached": False,
                "processing_time": time.time() - start_time
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "error": str(e),
                "processing_time": time.time() - start_time
            }

**user**: I'm concerned with API usage in the script. According to the Azure Strategy Guide, how can the script benefit?  
[Timestamp: 2024/11/23 19:08:10]

**ai**: To optimize API usage in your script, you can leverage several strategies outlined in the Azure OpenAI Strategy Guide. Here are some key approaches that can benefit your script:

1. **Token Management and Cost Optimization**:
   - Implement token estimation and management to control and reduce API costs. Use functions to estimate the number of tokens a request will consume and adjust your prompts accordingly to stay within budget.
   - Example: Use the `estimate_tokens` function to calculate the token count for a given prompt and truncate or optimize prompts to fit within a specified token limit.

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement a caching mechanism to store and reuse API responses for identical requests. This reduces redundant API calls and minimizes costs.
   - Example: Use a caching library like `diskcache` to store generated docstrings and check the cache before making a new API call.

3. **Batch Processing with Rate Limiting**:
   - Process multiple requests in batches and apply rate limiting to adhere to API quotas and optimize performance.
   - Example: Use an `asyncio.Semaphore` to limit the number of concurrent API requests and manage the load on the API.

4. **Error Handling and Monitoring**:
   - Implement robust error handling to manage API call failures and retries. Monitor API usage and performance to identify and address issues proactively.
   - Example: Use a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling transient API errors and log the details of each API call for monitoring.

5. **Advanced Integration Patterns**:
   - Integrate various components like caching, monitoring, and content filtering to create a robust and scalable system.
   - Example: Use a class like `AzureOpenAIIntegration` to manage these components and streamline the process of making API requests while ensuring content safety and efficient caching.

6. **Content Filtering and Safety**:
   - Implement content filtering to ensure the safety and appropriateness of AI-generated content, which can be crucial for maintaining compliance with content policies.
   - Example: Use a `ContentFilter` class to check the safety of generated content before using or displaying it.

By incorporating these strategies, your script can become more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable when interacting with the Azure OpenAI API. If you need further assistance in implementing any of these strategies, feel free to ask!

[Timestamp: 2024/11/23 19:08:41]

**ai**: To enhance the API usage in your script based on the Azure OpenAI Strategy Guide, you can implement several strategies to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase reliability. Hereâ€™s how you can apply these strategies to your codebase:

1. **Authentication and Setup**:
   - **Improvement**: Ensure robust setup by validating environment variables and handling errors gracefully. This includes checking for missing or incorrect API keys and endpoints. You can also log successful connections to confirm that the setup is correct.

2. **Function Calling and Structured Outputs**:
   - **Improvement**: Use structured outputs by defining schemas for expected docstring formats. This ensures consistency and reliability in the data returned by the API. Implement function calling with these schemas to guide the API in generating structured responses.

3. **Error Handling and Monitoring**:
   - **Improvement**: Enhance error handling by implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter to manage transient network issues. Use detailed logging to capture error codes and response times, and consider integrating a monitoring tool for real-time analytics.

4. **Token Management and Cost Optimization**:
   - **Improvement**: Implement token estimation and prompt optimization to manage API costs effectively. Use functions to calculate the number of tokens a request will consume and adjust prompts to fit within budget constraints. This can include truncating prompts that exceed token limits.

5. **Batch Processing and Rate Limiting**:
   - **Improvement**: Use batch processing with rate limiting to handle multiple requests efficiently. Implement semaphores to control the number of concurrent API requests, which helps adhere to API quotas and improves performance.

6. **Advanced Prompt Management**:
   - **Improvement**: Use dynamic prompts to tailor API requests based on specific inputs or conditions. Implement a `PromptTemplate` class to validate and format prompts with required variables, ensuring consistency and flexibility in prompt management.

7. **Content Filtering and Safety**:
   - **Improvement**: Implement a real content filtering mechanism in the `ContentFilter` class to detect and handle potentially unsafe or inappropriate content. Use predefined categories and thresholds to filter out unsafe content effectively.

8. **Caching Strategy**:
   - **Improvement**: Implement a robust caching strategy using a `ResponseCache` class with Redis to store frequently used responses. This reduces redundant API calls and improves performance by retrieving cached responses for identical requests.

9. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - **Potential Enhancement**: Consider integrating RAG to enhance AI responses by incorporating external knowledge sources. This can improve the quality and relevance of generated docstrings by providing additional context.

10. **Embedding Generation**:
    - **Potential Enhancement**: Implement embedding generation for tasks like similarity search and clustering. This can enhance the analysis and processing of text data, providing more insights and improving functionality.

By incorporating these strategies, your codebase can become more robust, efficient, and scalable, making it better suited for handling complex documentation and AI tasks.
