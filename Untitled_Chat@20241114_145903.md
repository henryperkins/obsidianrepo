**ai**: The error message you're encountering indicates that the `get_docstring` method of the `AzureOpenAIClient` class is being called without providing all the required positional arguments. Specifically, the method is missing the `params`, `return_type`, `complexity_score`, and `existing_docstring` arguments.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Method Call**: Ensure that wherever you are calling `get_docstring`, you are passing all the required arguments. The method signature is as follows:

   ```python
   async def get_docstring(
       self,
       func_name: str,
       params: List[Tuple[str, str]],
       return_type: str,
       complexity_score: int,
       existing_docstring: str,
       max_tokens: int = 500,
       temperature: float = 0.2
   ) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
   ```

   You need to provide values for `func_name`, `params`, `return_type`, `complexity_score`, and `existing_docstring`.

2. **Prepare the Arguments**: Before calling `get_docstring`, ensure you have gathered all necessary information about the function you are processing. This typically involves:

   - **`func_name`**: The name of the function.
   - **`params`**: A list of tuples representing parameter names and types.
   - **`return_type`**: The return type of the function.
   - **`complexity_score`**: A calculated complexity score for the function.
   - **`existing_docstring`**: The existing docstring, if any, or an empty string if none exists.

3. **Example Call**: Here's an example of how you might call `get_docstring` with all required arguments:

   ```python
   func_name = "example_function"
   params = [("param1", "int"), ("param2", "str")]
   return_type = "bool"
   complexity_score = 5
   existing_docstring = "This function does something."

   docstring_data = await azure_openai_client.get_docstring(
       func_name=func_name,
       params=params,
       return_type=return_type,
       complexity_score=complexity_score,
       existing_docstring=existing_docstring
   )
   ```

4. **Debugging**: If you're unsure where the method is being called, search your codebase for `get_docstring` calls and verify that all necessary arguments are being passed.

By ensuring that all required arguments are provided, you should be able to resolve this error. If you need further assistance with a specific part of your code, feel free to share it, and I can help you debug it further.
