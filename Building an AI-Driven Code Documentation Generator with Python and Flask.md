# Building an AI-Driven Code Documentation Generator with Python and Flask

Provide concise, complete, and contextually relevant answers to help build a cloud-enabled, user-friendly SaaS application named 'AI-Driven Code Documentation Generator' for automatic documentation generation using Python and Flask. The application should use Sphinx for documentation generation and support multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. 

Integrate AI capabilities to enhance the documentation process using Python AI libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers. Leverage either OpenAI's GPT-4 or Azure OpenAI services for AI-driven insights. Prioritize performance, security, and code quality throughout the implementation.

Key Requirements:
- **Full, Functional Code**: Ensure all generated code is ready for useâ€”no placeholders or incomplete snippets. Solutions must be immediately actionable, without the need for further adjustments.
- **RESTful API Design**: Adhere to REST principles when designing the API.
- **Backend Infrastructure (AWS)**: Utilize AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS (with PostgreSQL) for backend infrastructure.
- **Frontend Infrastructure (Azure)**: Deploy the frontend on Azure services like Azure App Service, Azure CDN, and Azure Front Door.

Additionally:
- **Deployment**: Implement deployment strategies using Docker and Jenkins.
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scalability to accommodate increasing user loads.
- **AI Integration**: Ensure secure data management and seamless API integration for the AI models, with monitoring and continuous improvement mechanisms.
- **Node.js Handlers**: Handle JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies using Node.js where applicable.
- **Configuration**: Manage configuration via `config.json` and environment variables.
- **Advanced Features**: Implement asynchronous processing, comprehensive logging (with log rotation), documentation report generation (including badges for complexity metrics), and robust error management.

These requirements are non-negotiable."
