###### YOU
I’ve compiled a list of videos in csv format with their file name, file size, duration and public url to feed to the script and process as a batch, how do I enable this functionality

###### BMO
To enable processing a list of videos from a CSV file in batch, you'll need to extend the script to:

1. **Read the CSV file**.
2. **Extract information for each video**, such as URL, file name, duration, etc.
3. **Feed this data into the existing pipeline** to process each video.

We'll add this functionality into your script by:

- Updating the **CLI** to support an input CSV file containing a list of videos.
- Reading the CSV file to extract URLs and related metadata.
- Processing each video in the CSV file.

Below is the breakdown of modifications and code snippets to accomplish this:

---

### 1. **Update the CLI to Accept a CSV File**

In the `interface.py` script, modify the `parse_arguments()` function to add an argument that allows users to specify a CSV file containing a list of video URLs. This will involve adding a `--csv` option.

- **Updated Argument Parsing** in `interface.py`:

```python
import csv

def parse_arguments():
    """
    Parses command-line arguments provided by the user.

    Returns:
        Namespace: Parsed command-line arguments.
    """
    config = load_config()  # Load configuration from the config.ini file

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Comprehensive Video Processing Toolkit')

    # Set default values from the config file
    default_output = config.get('Paths', 'ProcessedDirectory', fallback='processed_videos/')
    default_scene_threshold = config.getfloat('SceneDetection', 'DefaultThreshold', fallback=0.3)
    default_qwen_instruction = config.get('QwenVL', 'DefaultInstruction', fallback="Describe this video.")
    
    parser.add_argument('--urls', nargs='+', help='List of video URLs to process')
    parser.add_argument('--csv', type=str, help='Path to the CSV file containing video URLs and metadata')  # New option for CSV input
    parser.add_argument('--config', type=str, help='Path to the configuration file', default='config.ini')
    parser.add_argument('--output', type=str, help='Output directory', default=default_output)
    parser.add_argument('--log_level', type=str, help='Set the logging level',
                        choices=['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'], default='INFO')
    
    # Processing options
    parser.add_argument('--scene_threshold', type=float, help='Threshold for scene detection', default=default_scene_threshold)
    parser.add_argument('--qwen_instruction', type=str, help='Instruction passed to Qwen-VL', default=default_qwen_instruction)
    parser.add_argument('--use_vpc', action='store_true', help='Use the VPC endpoint for Qwen-VL API calls')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Ensure they provided either URLs or a CSV, but not both
    if not args.urls and not args.csv:
        parser.error("You must provide either --urls or --csv to indicate which videos to process.")
    return args
```

---

### 2. **Reading and Processing the CSV File**

Once the CSV file is supplied through the `--csv` option, extend the script to:

- **Parse the CSV file**.
- **Extract the relevant details for each video** (e.g., URL, file name, size, etc.).
- **Process each video** in the same way as the current flow (for individual `--urls`).

The CSV file might look something like this:
```csv
filename,file_size,duration,url
video1.mp4,500MB,5:30,http://example.com/video1.mp4
video2.mov,1GB,10:00,http://example.com/video2.mov
```

We'll assume the CSV has at least the columns `url`, with optional columns like `filename`, `file_size`, and `duration`. Update the `main()` method in `interface.py` to handle the CSV.

- **Process CSV Input in `main()`**:

```python
def read_video_metadata_from_csv(csv_file):
    """
    Reads video metadata from a CSV file.
    
    Args:
        csv_file (str): Path to the CSV file containing video URLs and other metadata.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing video metadata (e.g., URL, filename).
    """
    videos = []

    with open(csv_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)  # Automatically read the CSV as dictionaries

        # Validate that the CSV contains at least 'url' field
        if 'url' not in reader.fieldnames:
            logging.error("The CSV file must contain at least a 'url' field.")
            return []

        for row in reader:
            # Make sure the URL field is present
            if row.get('url'):
                videos.append({
                    'url': row['url'],
                    'filename': row.get('filename'),
                    'file_size': row.get('file_size'),
                    'duration': row.get('duration')
                })

    return videos


def main():
    """Main function that initializes the CLI and coordinates the processing."""
    args = parse_arguments()

    # Setup logging with the specified log level
    setup_logging(log_file='video_processing.log')
    logging.getLogger().setLevel(args.log_level)  # Set to the specific log level provided in the CLI arguments

    # Load configuration from the specified config file
    config = load_config(args.config)

    # Ensure output directory exists
    ensure_directory(args.output)

    # If a CSV file was provided, read the video data from the CSV
    if args.csv:
        logging.info(f"Reading videos from CSV file: {args.csv}")
        videos = read_video_metadata_from_csv(args.csv)
        if not videos:
            logging.error(f"No video URLs found or invalid CSV format.")
            return
    else:
        # Use manual URLs provided via the --urls option
        videos = [{'url': url} for url in args.urls]

    # Iterate over provided or listed videos and process each video
    for video_info in videos:
        video_url = video_info.get('url')
        filename = video_info.get('filename', None)

        logging.info(f"Processing video from URL: {video_url}")
        
        # Run the full processing pipeline for the video
        process_video_pipeline(
            video_url=video_url,
            scene_threshold=args.scene_threshold,
            custom_rules=None,  # Optional: load custom rules if needed
            output_dir=args.output
        )

```

---

### 3. **Process Video Metadata from CSV**

In this updated version, the argument parsing is flexible, allowing either a direct list of `--urls` or a `--csv` file containing the video URLs and metadata.

- The `main()` function forks based on whether the user provides a CSV or individual URLs.
- The `read_video_metadata_from_csv()` function parses the CSV and extracts the list of video URLs and any optional metadata.
- The pipeline remains exactly the same: once the information is extracted from the CSV, the `process_video_pipeline()` function is called with the necessary information.

---

### 4. **Running the Script**

Once these changes are made, you can now run the script using a CSV file:

```bash
python interface.py --csv videos.csv --output processed_videos --log_level INFO
```

### CSV Format Example

The CSV file **(`videos.csv`)** might look like this:

```csv
filename,file_size,duration,url
video1.mp4,500MB,5:30,http://example.com/video1.mp4
video2.mov,1GB,10:00,http://example.com/video2.mov
```

In this setup:
- **filename** is optional: if provided, it's used for logging and identification.
- **file_size** and **duration** are optional and can be passed along for metadata extraction or skipping already processed videos (optional as a future enhancement).
- **url** is mandatory and is used by the script to download and process the video.

---

### 5. **Optional Enhancements**

If you'd like, you could:
1. **Use the `file_size` or `duration`** to enhance the processing, for example, to **filter videos based on size/duration** before processing.
2. **Optimize Processing for Already-Processed Videos**: If a video was processed already (based on the filename or some other metadata), you could skip re-processing it to save time. You could save a checksum/fingerprint of the video or its metadata in MongoDB for this purpose.

---

### **Summary of Changes**
- **Added CLI Argument**: `--csv` to support CSV input for batch video processing.
- **Read CSV File**: Extended the script to read video-related metadata from a CSV and extract URLs.
- **Batch Processing**: Every video from the CSV is processed in the pipeline using the `process_video_pipeline()` function.
  
This way, you can easily process a batch of videos listed in a CSV via one command!

###### YOU
This was the command to create the csv if that is useful in determining how to parse it: rclone lsf --format "pst" r2:vids | awk -v bucket_url="https://mybucket.online/vids/" \
'BEGIN {print "file_name,file_size,last_modified,public_url"} \
{print $1","$2","$3","bucket_url $1}' > file_info_with_urls.csv

###### BMO
Thanks for sharing the command that you used to generate the CSV. Let’s break down the structure and adjust the script accordingly. 

Given the structure provided by the command:

```bash
rclone lsf --format "pst" r2:vids | awk -v bucket_url="https://mybucket.online/vids/" \
'BEGIN {print "file_name,file_size,last_modified,public_url"} \
{print $1","$2","$3","bucket_url $1}' > file_info_with_urls.csv
```

The CSV will have the following columns:
- **`file_name`**: The name of the video file.
- **`file_size`**: The size of the file in a human-readable format.
- **`last_modified`**: Timestamp representing the last modified date and time of the file.
- **`public_url`**: The public URL from which the file can be downloaded (calculated from `bucket_url` + `file_name`).

### Parsing This CSV

To properly parse the CSV based on its structure, we need to:
1. Adjust the CSV-parsing function so it captures the correct columns (`file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, and `public_url`).
2. Use relevant columns where needed (the primary one being `public_url`).

### Let's Update the Code for CSV Parsing

```python
import csv
import logging

def read_video_metadata_from_csv(csv_file):
    """
    Reads video metadata from a CSV file created with rclone.

    Args:
        csv_file (str): Path to the CSV file containing video metadata.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing video metadata (e.g., filename, file_size, public_url).
    """
    videos = []

    # Attempt to read the CSV file
    with open(csv_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)

        # Validate that the necessary columns exist in the CSV
        required_columns = ['file_name', 'file_size', 'last_modified', 'public_url']
        for col in required_columns:
            if col not in reader.fieldnames:
                logging.error(f"The CSV file must contain the following columns: {', '.join(required_columns)}")
                return []

        # Read each row and append the video metadata
        for row in reader:
            # Check that the public URL is present
            if row.get('public_url'):
                videos.append({
                    'file_name': row.get('file_name'),
                    'file_size': row.get('file_size'),
                    'last_modified': row.get('last_modified'),
                    'public_url': row.get('public_url')
                })

    return videos
```

Here’s what happens:
- We're validating that the necessary columns (`file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, and `public_url`) are present.
- For each row, the script captures the values of `file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, and `public_url`, and stores them in a dictionary. The public URL is essential for the script since it's used to download and process the video content.

---

### Use Case

You will extract the public URL from this list and pass it to the `process_video_pipeline`. Other fields like `file_name` and `file_size` are not mandatory but are useful for logging or further enhancements.

Modify your `main()` function to support this CSV structure:

```python
def main():
    """Main function that initializes the CLI and coordinates the processing."""
    args = parse_arguments()

    # Setup logging with the specified log level
    setup_logging(log_file='video_processing.log')
    logging.getLogger().setLevel(args.log_level)  # Set to the specific log level provided in the CLI arguments

    # Load configuration from the specified config file
    config = load_config(args.config)

    # Ensure output directory exists
    ensure_directory(args.output)

    # If a CSV file was provided, read the video data from the CSV
    if args.csv:
        logging.info(f"Reading videos from CSV file: {args.csv}")
        videos = read_video_metadata_from_csv(args.csv)
        if not videos:
            logging.error(f"No videos found in the CSV or missing required columns.")
            return
    else:
        # Use manual URLs provided via --urls option
        videos = [{'public_url': url} for url in args.urls]

    # Iterate over videos and process each one
    for video_info in videos:
        video_url = video_info.get('public_url')
        filename = video_info.get('file_name', None)  # Optional for logging

        logging.info(f"Processing video: {filename} from URL: {video_url}")
        
        # Run the full processing pipeline for the given video
        process_video_pipeline(
            video_url=video_url,
            scene_threshold=args.scene_threshold,
            custom_rules=None,  # Optionally load custom rules if needed
            output_dir=args.output
        )
```

### Explanation:

- **`read_video_metadata_from_csv`** handles the parsing of the CSV file, ensuring that it captures all the key details (`file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, `public_url`). The most important field for processing is `public_url`, which will be passed as the download URL.
- In **`main()`**, it checks if the user provided a CSV. If so, the script reads video data from the CSV into the `videos` variable, which contains a list of dictionaries (with fields like `file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, and `public_url`).
- **Processing each video**: For each video, it extracts the `public_url` and optionally logs the `file_name` for better traceability. Then the script proceeds with calling `process_video_pipeline()` to download and process the video file.

---

### Sample Execution:

Assuming your CSV file is named `file_info_with_urls.csv`, you can now run it like this:

```bash
python interface.py --csv file_info_with_urls.csv --output processed_videos --log_level INFO
```

The script will:
- Parse the CSV.
- Captures each video's metadata (especially the public URL).
- Processes each video iteratively by downloading it, generating metadata, detecting scenes, and interacting with the image/text models if applicable.

### Final CSV: Example

```csv
file_name,file_size,last_modified,public_url
video1.mp4,500MB,2023-10-10T12:00:00Z,https://mybucket.online/vids/video1.mp4
video2.mov,1GB,2023-09-15T15:45:32Z,https://mybucket.online/vids/video2.mov
```

---

### Logging and Output Considerations

- **Logging**: The script logs each video's filename and URL as it processes it.
- **Enhanced Metadata**: If you want to enhance the metadata by logging `file_size` or `file_name` for each video, you can include that in either the logging lines or as additional information stored and exported after processing (useful when dealing with a large set of videos).
  
### Optional Enhancements:

1. **Metadata Validation**: If you want to ensure certain constraints (e.g., skip small videos based on `file_size` or process only those modified after a certain date using `last_modified`), you can easily add filters using the `file_size` and `last_modified` fields.
2. **Skipping Already Processed Videos**: Implement a logic that checks if a video (or its metadata) has already been processed and skip reprocessing to save time.

---

### Summary:
- **CSV Parsing**: You now have functionality for reading CSV files structured based on your `rclone` command output format.
- **Processing in Batches**: The script can process each video listed in the CSV by downloading, analyzing, and exporting as needed.
  
This should handle your batch processing from CSV smoothly. Let me know if you run into any issues, or need further adjustments!

###### YOU
Provide the JSON formatted input to parse this csv there by directly inferring wity the model

###### BMO
To provide a JSON-formatted input based on the provided CSV for direct inference with the model (i.e., bypassing some of the pipeline steps), let me clarify what you likely want to do:

### Scenario:
You want to take the information from the CSV and prepare it in a ready-to-process JSON format that can be passed directly to the model for inference (e.g., for content analysis using the Qwen2-VL model). This assumes you already have the necessary metadata (`file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, and `public_url`) from your CSV, and now want to encapsulate that information into a JSON format to be used directly by the model.

### Sample Workflow:

1. **CSV File Input (From `rclone` Command):**

Format of your CSV (`file_info_with_urls.csv`):

```csv
file_name,file_size,last_modified,public_url
video1.mp4,500MB,2023-10-10T12:00:00Z,https://mybucket.online/vids/video1.mp4
video2.mov,1GB,2023-09-15T15:45:32Z,https://mybucket.online/vids/video2.mov
```

2. **Desired JSON-Formatted Input:**

Each CSV row is translated into a JSON object for use by the model, particularly for Qwen2-VL inference (or another inference model). The JSON structure should include useful fields from your CSV such as `file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, and `public_url`.

Here’s an example of how we can transform each CSV row into JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "file_name": "video1.mp4",
        "file_size": "500MB",
        "last_modified": "2023-10-10T12:00:00Z",
        "public_url": "https://mybucket.online/vids/video1.mp4"
    },
    {
        "file_name": "video2.mov",
        "file_size": "1GB",
        "last_modified": "2023-09-15T15:45:32Z",
        "public_url": "https://mybucket.online/vids/video2.mov"
    }
]
```

This format creates an easy-to-process structure for your model or another processing pipeline.

---

### Python Script to Convert CSV to JSON-Formatted Input

Here’s a Python code snippet to convert your CSV file to a JSON structure that can be used by the model for inference.

```python
import csv
import json

def csv_to_json(csv_file, output_json_file):
    """
    Converts a CSV file into a JSON-formatted array of dictionaries.
    
    Args:
        csv_file (str): The path to the CSV file (e.g., from rclone).
        output_json_file (str): The file name/path where the JSON output will be saved.

    Returns:
        None: The function writes JSON output to a file.
    """
    videos = []

    with open(csv_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)

        for row in reader:
            video_data = {
                "file_name": row['file_name'],
                "file_size": row['file_size'],
                "last_modified": row['last_modified'],
                "public_url": row['public_url']
            }
            videos.append(video_data)

    # Writing JSON output to the
    with open(output_json_file, 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(videos, json_file, indent=2)
        print(f"JSON output successfully written to {output_json_file}")

# Example usage:
csv_file = "file_info_with_urls.csv"  # Path to your CSV
output_json_file = "videos.json"  # Path where the JSON output will be written

csv_to_json(csv_file, output_json_file)
```

### Explanation:
- **CSV to Dictionary:** The script reads through each row of the CSV and converts it into a dictionary format (based on `file_name`, `file_size`, `last_modified`, `public_url`).
- **List of Video Information:** The script appends each dictionary (representing a video) to a list.
- **JSON Output:** The list of dictionaries is then written into a JSON file with formatted and indented output for readability.
  
### Running the Script:

Once you have the script written, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Make sure to replace `script_name.py` with your actual filename, or you can run this within an IDE/Jupyter Notebook. The JSON will be stored in `videos.json`.

---

### Sample Output JSON (`videos.json`):

This JSON file can then directly be used for inference with models like Qwen2-VL (assuming you're passing the `public_url` to let the model process the video content based on the URL):

```json
[
  {
    "file_name": "video1.mp4",
    "file_size": "500MB",
    "last_modified": "2023-10-10T12:00:00Z",
    "public_url": "https://mybucket.online/vids/video1.mp4"
  },
  {
    "file_name": "video2.mov",
    "file_size": "1GB",
    "last_modified": "2023-09-15T15:45:32Z",
    "public_url": "https://mybucket.online/vids/video2.mov"
  }
]
```

This can now be used for:
- **Direct Model Inference**: Feed `public_url` directly to the Qwen2-VL model, where the model extracts relevant video insights. You can track or log additional fields (e.g., `file_name`, `file_size`) for further processing or metrics but the essential field here is `public_url`.

---

### Integration with Model Inference

If you're performing inference from this JSON, here’s a quick example of how you might loop through this JSON for model inference:

```python
import json
from core import query_qwen_vl_chat

# Load the JSON file
with open('videos.json', 'r') as json_file:
    videos = json.load(json_file)

# Model Inference (Assuming Qwen2-VL)
def run_inference_on_videos(videos):
    results = []

    for video in videos:
        public_url = video['public_url']
        file_name = video['file_name']  # For logging purposes
        
        # Call the model, passing the public URL for Qwen2-VL analysis
        description = query_qwen_vl_chat(public_url, instruction="Describe this video.")

        # Save the results
        results.append({
            'file_name': file_name,
            'description': description
        })
    
    return results

# Run Inference
inference_results = run_inference_on_videos(videos)

# Optionally print or save the results
print(json.dumps(inference_results, indent=2))
```

### Summary

1. **CSV to JSON Conversion Script**: Converts your `rclone`-generated CSV to a JSON format that can directly be used for inference.
2. **Model Inference Example**: Loops over the JSON to run video URL inference with Qwen2-VL.
   
You can now directly provide this JSON as input to automate the content analysis process. If you adopt this structure, your model will be able to perform inference on each video URL listed in the JSON! Let me know if you need anything else.

###### YOU
Is it possible to feed the model these videos in 15 second clips

###### BMO
Yes, it's possible to feed videos to the model in 15-second clips, but it requires some additional steps to segment the videos before sending them for processing. Here's a breakdown of how you can implement this:

### 1. Video Segmentation

You'll need to segment your videos into 15-second clips. FFmpeg is a great tool for this. Here's a Python function using `ffmpeg-python` to do this:

```python
import subprocess

def segment_video(input_video, output_dir, segment_length=15):
    """
    Segments a video into clips of a specified length.

    Args:
        input_video (str): Path to the input video file.
        output_dir (str): Directory to save the segmented clips.
        segment_length (int): Length of each segment in seconds.
    """
    try:
        # Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

        # Use ffmpeg to segment the video
        command = [
            'ffmpeg',
            '-i', input_video,
            '-c', 'copy',  # Use copy to avoid re-encoding for speed
            '-f', 'segment',
            '-segment_time', str(segment_length),
            f'{output_dir}/clip_%03d.mp4'  # Output file naming pattern
        ]
        subprocess.run(command, check=True)

        print(f"Video '{input_video}' segmented into {segment_length}-second clips.")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error segmenting video: {e}")
```

### 2. Update the JSON Structure

You'll need to modify the JSON structure to accommodate the clips. Instead of just having a `public_url` for the entire video, you'll have a list of URLs, each pointing to a 15-second segment.

```json
[
  {
    "file_name": "video1.mp4",
    "file_size": "500MB",
    "last_modified": "2023-10-10T12:00:00Z",
    "segments": [
      "https://mybucket.online/vids/video1_clip_001.mp4",
      "https://mybucket.online/vids/video1_clip_002.mp4",
      # ... more segment URLs
    ]
  },
  { 
    // ... data for other videos
  }
]
```

### 3. Modify the Inference Loop

You'll need to update the inference loop to process each segment individually.

```python
import json
from core import query_qwen_vl_chat

# Load the JSON file
with open('videos.json', 'r') as json_file:
    videos = json.load(json_file)

# Model Inference (Assuming Qwen2-VL)
def run_inference_on_videos(videos):
    all_results = []

    for video in videos:
        file_name = video['file_name']
        segment_results = []  # Store results for each segment

        for segment_url in video['segments']:
            # Call the model, passing the segment URL for Qwen2-VL analysis
            description = query_qwen_vl_chat(segment_url, instruction="Describe this video segment.")
            segment_results.append({
                'segment_url': segment_url,
                'description': description
            })

        # Aggregate results for the entire video
        all_results.append({
            'file_name': file_name,
            'segments': segment_results
        })
    
    return all_results

# Run Inference
inference_results = run_inference_on_videos(videos)

# Optionally print or save the results
print(json.dumps(inference_results, indent=2))
```

### 4. Putting it All Together

Here's how you can combine these steps:

```python
import os
import json
from core import query_qwen_vl_chat  # Assuming this function exists in core.py

# ... (Video Segmentation and CSV to JSON functions from previous responses)

def process_videos_from_csv(csv_file, output_json_file, segment_length=15):
    """
    Processes videos from a CSV, segments them, and prepares JSON for inference.
    """
    videos = read_video_metadata_from_csv(csv_file)
    
    for video in videos:
        video['segments'] = []
        
        # Segment the video
        output_dir = os.path.join("segmented_videos", video['file_name'])
        segment_video(video['public_url'], output_dir, segment_length)

        # Get segment URLs (assuming they are uploaded to your bucket)
        for i in range(1, 999):  # Assuming a reasonable max number of segments
            segment_url = f"{video['public_url'][:-4]}_clip_{i:03d}.mp4"
            if os.path.exists(os.path.join(output_dir, f"clip_{i:03d}.mp4")):
                video['segments'].append(segment_url)
            else:
                break  # Stop checking for segments if the file doesn't exist

    # Save the updated data to JSON
    with open(output_json_file, 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(videos, json_file, indent=2)
        print(f"JSON output successfully written to {output_json_file}")

# Example usage:
csv_file = "file_info_with_urls.csv"
output_json_file = "videos_with_segments.json"
process_videos_from_csv(csv_file, output_json_file)

# ... (Model inference code from the previous step)
```

### Considerations:

- **Computational Cost:** Processing videos in segments will increase the computational cost as you're making multiple API calls.
- **Context Loss:** Segmenting videos might lead to some context loss. If the model requires a broader understanding of the video, processing in segments might not be ideal.
- **Segment Overlap:** You might consider adding overlapping segments (e.g., 15-second segments with a 5-second overlap) to reduce context loss between segments.

This approach allows you to process videos in smaller, manageable chunks, which can be beneficial for long videos or when dealing with API limitations.

###### YOU
The json input should likely specify video resolution to process no higher than 720p and 30 fps

###### BMO
You are correct! Specifying the desired video resolution and frame rate in the JSON input is a good practice, especially when working with models that might have limitations or when you want to optimize for efficiency. 

Here's how you can modify the JSON structure and the script to include this information:

### 1. Update the JSON Structure

Add fields for `max_resolution` and `max_fps` to your JSON, indicating the maximum resolution and frame rate you want the model to process:

```json
[
  {
    "file_name": "video1.mp4",
    "file_size": "500MB",
    "last_modified": "2023-10-10T12:00:00Z",
    "segments": [
      "https://mybucket.online/vids/video1_clip_001.mp4",
      "https://mybucket.online/vids/video1_clip_002.mp4",
      # ... more segment URLs
    ],
    "max_resolution": "720p",
    "max_fps": 30
  },
  { 
    // ... data for other videos
  }
]
```

### 2. Modify the Video Segmentation

You'll need to update the `segment_video` function to downscale the video to 720p and 30fps during the segmentation process. This ensures that the segments are created with the desired specifications.

```python
import subprocess

def segment_video(input_video, output_dir, segment_length=15, max_resolution="720p", max_fps=30):
    """
    Segments a video into clips, downscaling to a maximum resolution and frame rate.

    Args:
        input_video (str): Path to the input video file.
        output_dir (str): Directory to save the segmented clips.
        segment_length (int): Length of each segment in seconds.
        max_resolution (str): Maximum resolution (e.g., "720p", "1080p").
        max_fps (int): Maximum frame rate.
    """
    try:
        os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

        command = [
            'ffmpeg',
            '-i', input_video,
            '-vf', f'scale=trunc(min(iw\,1280)/2)*2:trunc(min(ih\,720)/2)*2,fps={max_fps}',  # Downscale filter
            '-c:v', 'libx264',  # Re-encode with libx264 for compatibility
            '-c:a', 'copy',  # Copy audio codec
            '-f', 'segment',
            '-segment_time', str(segment_length),
            f'{output_dir}/clip_%03d.mp4'
        ]
        subprocess.run(command, check=True)

        print(f"Video '{input_video}' segmented into {segment_length}-second clips.")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error segmenting video: {e}")
```

### 3. Update the CSV to JSON Conversion

Modify the CSV to JSON conversion script to include the `max_resolution` and `max_fps` fields in the JSON output.

```python
import csv
import json

def csv_to_json(csv_file, output_json_file, max_resolution="720p", max_fps=30):
    """
    Converts a CSV file into a JSON-formatted array of dictionaries,
    including resolution and frame rate limits.
    """
    videos = []

    with open(csv_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)

        for row in reader:
            video_data = {
                "file_name": row['file_name'],
                "file_size": row['file_size'],
                "last_modified": row['last_modified'],
                "public_url": row['public_url'],
                "segments": [],  # Segments will be added later
                "max_resolution": max_resolution,
                "max_fps": max_fps
            }
            videos.append(video_data)

    # ... (rest of the code to segment videos and add segment URLs)

# Example usage:
csv_to_json("file_info_with_urls.csv", "videos_with_segments.json", "720p", 30)
```

### 4. Pass Resolution and FPS to the Model (Important!)

You'll need to modify the `query_qwen_vl_chat` function (or any function that interacts with your model) to accept and use the `max_resolution` and `max_fps` parameters. 

**Important:** How you pass these parameters to the model depends entirely on the model's API or interface. 

- **If the model's API accepts resolution and FPS parameters:** Pass the values directly.
- **If the model doesn't directly support these parameters:** You might need to pre-process the video segments (downscale and frame rate adjustment) before sending them to the model.

**Example (Assuming the model API supports resolution and FPS):**

```python
def query_qwen_vl_chat(video_url, instruction="Describe this video.", max_resolution=None, max_fps=None):
    """
    Sends a request to the Qwen-VL-Chat model API over HTTPS to process a video.

    Args:
        video_url (str): The URL of the video file.
        instruction (str): The instruction or query to be passed to the AI model.
        max_resolution (str, optional): Maximum resolution for processing (e.g., "720p").
        max_fps (int, optional): Maximum frame rate for processing.

    Returns:
        str: The model's response.
    """
    # ... (Your existing code)

    # Prepare the request payload, including resolution and FPS if provided
    payload = {
        "video_url": video_url,
        "instruction": instruction,
    }
    if max_resolution:
        payload["max_resolution"] = max_resolution
    if max_fps:
        payload["max_fps"] = max_fps

    # ... (Rest of your API call logic)
```

### Summary

By making these changes, you:
- Explicitly specify the desired resolution and frame rate in the JSON input.
- Ensure that video segments are created with these specifications.
- (Most importantly) Pass this information to the model for more efficient processing.

Remember to consult the documentation for your specific model (Qwen2-VL in this case) to understand how to best utilize the resolution and frame rate parameters during inference.

**Explanation:**

1. **`segment_video` Function:**
   - Now takes `max_resolution` and `max_fps` as arguments.
   - Uses these values in the `ffmpeg` command to downscale the video during segmentation.

2. **`csv_to_json` Function:**
   - Takes `max_resolution` and `max_fps` as arguments.
   - Includes these values in the JSON output for each video.
   - Calls `segment_video` with the resolution and FPS limits.

3. **`run_inference_on_videos` Function:**
   - Passes `max_resolution` and `max_fps` to the `query_qwen_vl_chat` function (or your equivalent model inference function).

4. **`main` Function:**
   - Retrieves `max_resolution` and `max_fps` from either command-line arguments or the configuration file.
   - Calls `csv_to_json` to generate the JSON with the specified limits.
   - Loads the generated JSON and proceeds with inference.

**Key Points:**

- **Model Compatibility:** Ensure your model's API (`query_qwen_vl_chat` in this example) can handle the `max_resolution` and `max_fps` parameters. You might need to adjust how you pass these values based on the API's requirements.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, especially around the `ffmpeg` subprocess calls, to catch any issues during video segmentation.
- **Configuration:** Consider adding options to your `config.ini` file to allow users to configure the default `max_resolution` and `max_fps` values.

This integrated approach ensures that your video processing toolkit can handle resolution and FPS limitations effectively, making it more efficient and compatible with a wider range of models and use cases.

###### YOU
What file does this go in

###### BMO
You're right to ask about file organization! It's important for maintainability. 

Here's how I'd suggest integrating the code into your existing files, assuming you want to keep the resolution/FPS limiting as part of your core functionality:

1. **`analysis.py` (or Similar):**
   - Place the updated `segment_video` function in `analysis.py`. This file already handles video analysis tasks, so it's a logical place for video segmentation.

2. **`interface.py`:**
   - The updated `main` function should remain in `interface.py`, as it handles the overall script execution and command-line arguments.
   - You can either:
     - **Keep `csv_to_json` and `run_inference_on_videos` in `interface.py`**: This keeps all the main logic in one place.
     - **Move them to a new file (e.g., `processing.py`)**: This improves organization if these functions become more complex.

3. **`core.py`:**
   - Ensure that the `query_qwen_vl_chat` function (or your model inference function) in `core.py` is updated to handle the `max_resolution` and `max_fps` parameters.

**Example File Structure:**

```
video_processing_toolkit/
├── core.py          # Core functions, including model interaction
├── analysis.py      # Video analysis functions (including segmentation)
├── tagging.py       # Tagging and classification functions
├── export.py        # Data export functions
├── interface.py     # Command-line interface and main script logic
└── processing.py   # (Optional) Additional processing functions 
```

**Example Code Integration:**

```python
# analysis.py
import subprocess
from core import ensure_directory

def segment_video(...):  # Updated function from previous response

# interface.py
import os
import json
from core import load_config, setup_logging, query_qwen_vl_chat
from analysis import segment_video  # Import the updated function

# ... (Other imports)

def csv_to_json(...):  # Function from previous response
    # ...

def run_inference_on_videos(...):  # Function from previous response
    # ...

def main():
    # ... (Updated main function from previous response)

# processing.py (Optional)
import json
from core import query_qwen_vl_chat

def csv_to_json(...):
    # ...

def run_inference_on_videos(...):
    # ... 
```

**Remember:**

- Adjust the file names and organization based on your project's structure and preferences.
- Ensure that you import the necessary functions correctly after moving or renaming files.
- Update your `config.ini` file if you add configuration options for resolution and FPS limits.

By organizing your code logically, you'll make it easier to maintain, extend, and understand as your video processing toolkit grows.
