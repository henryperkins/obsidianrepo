**user**: Summarize these directions: ### **Step 1: Import the Logger Utilities**

In your module, import the necessary classes and functions from `logger.py`:

```python
from logger import LoggerSetup, CorrelationLoggerAdapter, log_error, log_warning, log_info, log_debug
```

---

### **Step 2: Configure the Logger (Optional)**

Before using the logger, you can configure it using `LoggerSetup.configure()`. This step is optional because the logger will use default settings if not configured. It's recommended to configure the logger once in your application's entry point (e.g., `main.py`), so all modules use the same settings.

```python
# In your main application file (e.g., main.py)
from logger import LoggerSetup

LoggerSetup.configure(
    level="DEBUG",                # Set logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    format_str="%(levelname)s: %(message)s",  # Console log format
    log_dir="logs",               # Directory for log files
    file_logging_enabled=True     # Enable or disable file logging
)
```

---

### **Step 3: Get a Logger Instance**

In your module, obtain a logger instance using `LoggerSetup.get_logger()`. Use `__name__` to name the logger after your module.

```python
# In your module (e.g., my_module.py)
from logger import LoggerSetup

logger = LoggerSetup.get_logger(__name__)
```

---

### **Step 4: Use the Logger**

Use the standard logging methods (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`) on the logger instance to log messages at various levels.

```python
# Example usage in your module
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
```

---

### **Step 5: Use Correlation IDs (Optional)**

If you need to include a correlation ID in your logs (useful for tracing requests or transactions across different modules or services), you can use the `CorrelationLoggerAdapter`.

```python
from logger import LoggerSetup, CorrelationLoggerAdapter

# Get the base logger
base_logger = LoggerSetup.get_logger(__name__)

# Create a correlation ID (e.g., from an incoming request)
correlation_id = "12345-abcde"

# Create a logger adapter with the correlation ID
logger = CorrelationLoggerAdapter(base_logger, correlation_id)

# Use the logger as usual
logger.info("This is an info message with a correlation ID.")
```

This will include the `correlation_id` in the log records, aiding in tracing and debugging.

---

### **Step 6: Log Exceptions**

To log exceptions along with stack traces, use the `logger.exception()` method, which logs an ERROR level message and includes the exception information.

```python
try:
    # Code that may throw an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception("An error occurred during division.")
```

---

### **Step 7: Use Module-Level Utility Functions (Optional)**

If you prefer to use the module-level utility functions provided in `logger.py`, you can do so. These functions internally obtain the logger instance and log the messages.

```python
from logger import log_info, log_debug, log_warning, log_error

# Use the utility functions
log_info("This is an info message.")
log_debug("This is a debug message.")
log_warning("This is a warning message.")
log_error("This is an error message.")
```

---

### **Step 8: Handle Uncaught Exceptions (Optional)**

To ensure that uncaught exceptions are logged, set the global exception hook to `LoggerSetup.handle_exception`. This should typically be done in your application's entry point.

```python
import sys
from logger import LoggerSetup

sys.excepthook = LoggerSetup.handle_exception
```

---

### **Example Module Using `logger.py`**

Here's a complete example demonstrating how to use the new `logger.py` in a module:

```python
# my_module.py

from logger import LoggerSetup, CorrelationLoggerAdapter

# Get the base logger
base_logger = LoggerSetup.get_logger(__name__)

# Optionally, use a correlation ID
correlation_id = "12345-abcde"
logger = CorrelationLoggerAdapter(base_logger, correlation_id)

def perform_task():
    logger.info("Starting task.")

    try:
        # Code that might raise an exception
        result = compute_result()
        logger.debug(f"Computation result: {result}")
    except Exception:
        logger.exception("An error occurred during computation.")

def compute_result():
    # Simulate an error
    return 10 / 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    perform_task()
```

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Configure the Logger Once**: Configure the logger in your main application file to ensure consistent settings across all modules.

- **Use `__name__`**: When getting a logger instance, use `__name__` to create a logger specific to your module.

- **Logging Methods**: Use standard logging methods (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`) or the module-level utility functions.

- **Correlation IDs**: Utilize `CorrelationLoggerAdapter` to include a `correlation_id` in your logs when needed.

- **Exception Logging**: Use `logger.exception()` to log exceptions with stack traces.

- **Global Exception Handler**: Set `sys.excepthook` to capture and log unhandled exceptions globally.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Avoid Multiple Configurations**: Ensure `LoggerSetup.configure()` is called only once to prevent reconfiguration issues.

- **Sanitization**: Customize the `sanitize_message` and `sanitize_args` methods in `SanitizedLogFormatter` to match your application's needs for sanitizing sensitive data.

- **Log Levels**: Adjust the logging level in `LoggerSetup.configure()` based on your environment (e.g., `DEBUG` for development, `INFO` or `WARNING` for production).

- **Check Log Outputs**: Verify that logs are being correctly output to both the console and log files, and that they include all necessary information.

- **Structured Logging**: The logger is set up to output logs in JSON format to files, which can be parsed by log management tools.

---

### **Testing Your Setup**

- **Run Your Application**: Execute your application and perform actions that trigger logging statements.

- **Verify Log Files**: Check the log files in the specified log directory to ensure logs are being written as expected.

- **Inspect Logs**: Ensure that logs have the appropriate levels, messages, and include correlation IDs if used.

---

### **Advanced Usage**

- **Dynamic Correlation IDs**: If your application processes requests (e.g., web requests), you can generate a new correlation ID for each request and use it throughout the processing of that request.

- **Context Managers**: You can create a context manager to automatically add correlation IDs to logs within a context.

- **Integration with Frameworks**: When using frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django), integrate the logging configuration within the application's setup to capture logs from the framework and its components.

---

By incorporating `logger.py` into your modules as described, you set up a robust logging system that:

- Provides consistent logging across all modules.
- Includes optional correlation IDs for tracing.
- Sanitizes sensitive information.
- Supports both console and file logging with rotation.
- Handles exceptions gracefully.

Feel free to adapt and extend the logging setup to suit the specific needs of your application. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
