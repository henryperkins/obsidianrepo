Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Solutions Architect position at Amazon on the Data & AI team. With over a decade of experience in technical support, web development, and a deep passion for artificial intelligence and cloud computing, I am eager to contribute to your team and assist customers in adopting and optimizing AWS solutions.

My passion for AI extends beyond interest; I actively maintain profiles on leading AI platforms such as Hugging Face, Vertex AI, and Azure AI. I explore these platforms daily to understand their capabilities and develop AI-inspired scripts and web applications. Hosting these projects on GitHub and Cloudflare has enabled me to collaborate with the developer community and stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

As an Independent Technology Consultant, I integrate AI functionalities into web applications, enhancing user experiences and providing innovative solutions tailored to client needs. This hands-on experience with AI/ML technologies, Large Language Models, and Generative AI aligns closely with the qualifications for this role.

Previously, as a Happiness Engineer at Automattic, Inc., I honed my ability to communicate complex technical concepts in an approachable way. I provided technical support to a diverse user base, contributed to internal knowledge bases, and collaborated with developers to improve platform stability. My ability to translate intricate technical information empowers users with memorable and useful insights.

My educational pursuits, including a Bachelor’s Degree in Organizational Leadership at Arizona State University and the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, reflect my commitment to continuous learning. My coursework in project management and data analysis has equipped me with skills essential for effective project coordination and insightful data interpretation.

I am particularly drawn to Amazon’s innovation in AI and cloud technologies. The opportunity to leverage my technical expertise, passion for AI, and communication skills to develop and publish solutions using novel AI techniques is incredibly exciting. I am confident that my background and enthusiasm make me a strong fit for the Solutions Architect role.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my experience and skills align with your needs and how I can contribute to Amazon’s mission to empower businesses through AI and cloud solutions.

Sincerely,

Henry Perkins
