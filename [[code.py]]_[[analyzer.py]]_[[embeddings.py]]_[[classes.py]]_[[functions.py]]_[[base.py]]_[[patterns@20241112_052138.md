                    raise CacheConsistencyError(f"Write verification failed for {key}")
                
            except Exception as e:
                await self.metrics.record_cache_error(key, str(e))
                raise CacheOperationError(f"Cache set failed: {str(e)}")
```

3. **Complete Vector Store Integration**:

```python
class CodeVectorStore:
    async def store_ast_node(self, node_type: str, node_data: Dict):
        retries = 0
        while retries < self.max_retries:
            try:
                # Validate node data
                self._validate_node_data(node_data)
                
                # Generate vector with fallback
                vector = await self._generate_vector_with_fallback(node_data)
                
                # Store with transaction
                async with self.transaction() as txn:
                    await txn.store(vector, node_data)
                    await txn.commit()
                
                return
                
            except Exception as e:
                retries += 1
                if retries == self.max_retries:
                    await self._handle_storage_failure(node_type, node_data, e)
                    raise
                await asyncio.sleep(self.retry_delay * retries)
```

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**:

```python
class RAGMonitor:
    async def record_operation(self, operation_type: str, duration: float):
        try:
            metrics = {
                "operation_type": operation_type,
                "duration": duration,
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "resource_usage": await self._get_resource_metrics(),
                "system_health": await self._check_system_health()
            }
            
            # Record metrics
            await self.metrics_store.store(metrics)
            
            # Check thresholds
            await self._check_alert_thresholds(metrics)
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Failed to record metrics", exc_info=True)
            # Continue operation despite metrics failure
```

class MetricsCalculator:  
    def calculate_cognitive_complexity(self):

# TODO: Implement Cognitive Complexity Calculation

        pass

    def _analyze_branch_depth(self):
        # TODO: Implement branch depth analysis

[Timestamp: 2024/11/12 05:32:46]

**ai**: To implement the `MetricsCalculator` class with methods for calculating cognitive complexity and analyzing branch depth, we need to understand the concepts behind these metrics:

1. **Cognitive Complexity**: This metric measures how difficult a piece of code is to understand. Unlike cyclomatic complexity, which counts the number of paths through the code, cognitive complexity considers the readability and maintainability of the code by accounting for factors like nesting and control flow.
2. **Branch Depth**: This metric measures the maximum depth of nested branches (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while` statements) in the code. Deeply nested code can be harder to read and maintain.

Here's a possible implementation for these methods:

```python
import ast

class MetricsCalculator:
    def calculate_cognitive_complexity(self, node: ast.AST) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the cognitive complexity of a given AST node.

        Args:
            node (ast.AST): The AST node to analyze.

        Returns:
            int: The cognitive complexity score.
        """
        complexity = 0
        nesting_level = 0

        for child in ast.walk(node):
            if isinstance(child, (ast.If, ast.While, ast.For, ast.AsyncFor)):
                # Increase complexity for each control structure
                complexity += 1 + nesting_level
                nesting_level += 1
            elif isinstance(child, ast.BoolOp):
                # Increase complexity for boolean operations
                complexity += len(child.values) - 1
            elif isinstance(child, (ast.Break, ast.Continue)):
                # Increase complexity for break/continue statements
                complexity += 1

        return complexity

    def _analyze_branch_depth(self, node: ast.AST) -> int:
        """
        Analyze the maximum branch depth of a given AST node.

        Args:

                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif isinstance(child, ast.FunctionDef):  # Don't descend into nested functions
                continue

        return max_depth

# Example usage

    code = """
def example_function(x):
    if x > 0:
        for i in range(x):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                print(i)
            else:
                continue
    else:
        print("Negative")
    """

    tree = ast.parse(code)
    calculator = MetricsCalculator()
    cognitive_complexity = calculator.calculate_cognitive_complexity(tree)
    branch_depth = calculator._analyze_branch_depth(tree)

    print(f"Cognitive Complexity: {cognitive_complexity}")
    print(f"Branch Depth: {branch_depth}")
```

## Explanation

- **Cognitive Complexity**:
  - The method `calculate_cognitive_complexity` walks through the AST nodes and increases the complexity score based on control structures and boolean operations.
  - It considers nesting by adding the current nesting level to the complexity score for each control structure.
- **Branch Depth**:
  - The method `_analyze_branch_depth` calculates the maximum depth of nested branches by walking through the AST nodes and tracking the current depth.
  - It updates the maximum depth whenever a deeper level is encountered.

These implementations provide a basic framework for calculating cognitive complexity and branch depth. You can further refine these methods by considering additional factors or customizing the complexity weights based on your specific requirements.

**user**: # api/api_client.py has incomplete error propagation:  
class APIClient:  
    async def analyze_code(self, code_content: str):

            raise  # Generic raise loses context
[Timestamp: 2024/11/12 05:33:29]

**ai**: To improve error propagation in the `APIClient` class, it's important to capture specific exceptions, provide detailed logging, and raise custom exceptions that preserve the original error context. This approach helps in diagnosing issues more effectively and ensures that the calling code can handle different error scenarios appropriately.

Here's an enhanced version of the `APIClient` class with improved error handling:

```python
import logging
from typing import Any, Dict

# Assuming AzureAPIError and CodeAnalysisError are custom exceptions defined elsewhere
class AzureAPIError(Exception):
    """Exception raised for errors in the Azure API."""
    pass

class CodeAnalysisError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, message: str, original_error: Exception, context: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.original_error = original_error
        self.context = context or {}

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class APIClient:
    def __init__(self, azure_client: Any):
        self.azure = azure_client

    async def analyze_code(self, code_content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Analyze code using Azure's API.

        Args:

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: The analysis result.

        Raises:
            CodeAnalysisError: If the analysis fails.
        """
        try:
            result = await self.azure.analyze_code(code_content)
            return result
        except AzureAPIError as e:
            logger.error("Azure API error during code analysis", extra={
                "error_type": type(e).__name__,
                "error_details": str(e),
                "code_hash": self._generate_code_hash(code_content)
            })
            raise CodeAnalysisError(
                message="Azure analysis failed",
                original_error=e,
                context={"code_hash": self._generate_code_hash(code_content)}
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Unexpected error during code analysis", exc_info=True)
            raise CodeAnalysisError(
                message="Unexpected error during code analysis",
                original_error=e
            )

    def _generate_code_hash(self, code_content: str) -> str:
        """Generate a hash for the code content for logging purposes."""
        import hashlib
        return hashlib.sha256(code_content.encode()).hexdigest()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Mock Azure client for demonstration purposes
    class MockAzureClient:
        async def analyze_code(self, code_content: str):
            # Simulate an error
            raise AzureAPIError("Simulated Azure API failure")

    azure_client = MockAzureClient()
    api_client = APIClient(azure_client)

    try:
        result = asyncio.run(api_client.analyze_code("print('Hello, World!')"))
    except CodeAnalysisError as e:
        logger.error(f"Code analysis failed: {e}, context: {e.context}")
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Specific Exception Handling**:
   - Catch specific exceptions like `AzureAPIError` to handle known error scenarios separately.

2. **Custom Exception with Context**:
   - Use a custom exception `CodeAnalysisError` that includes the original error and additional context, such as a hash of the code content. This helps in tracing and debugging.

3. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Log detailed error information, including the error type, details, and a hash of the code content. This aids in diagnosing issues without exposing sensitive code content.

4. **Preserving Error Context**:
   - Preserve the original exception context by passing it to the custom exception. This ensures that the stack trace and error details are not lost.

5. **Utility Method for Hashing**:
   - Implement a utility method `_generate_code_hash` to create a hash of the code content for logging purposes. This helps in identifying the specific code that caused the error without logging the entire content.

By implementing these improvements, the `APIClient` class becomes more robust and provides better error handling and diagnostics.

[Timestamp: 2024/11/12 05:34:33]

**ai**: To fully integrate the `EnhancedRAGSystem` class, we need to initialize and incorporate the missing components: the document processor, query optimizer, and response formatter. These components are essential for processing documents, optimizing queries, and formatting responses, respectively.

Here's how you can enhance the `EnhancedRAGSystem` class with these integrations:

```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Assuming these classes are defined elsewhere in the project
class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, chunk_size: int = 500, chunk_overlap: int = 50):
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.chunk_overlap = chunk_overlap

    def process_documents(self, documents: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        # Implement document processing logic
        return [{"content": doc, "metadata": {}} for doc in documents]

class QueryOptimizer:
    def optimize_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implement query optimization logic
        return query.lower().strip()

class ResponseFormatter:
    def format_response(self, response: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement response formatting logic
        return response

@dataclass
class RAGConfig:
    # Configuration fields for the RAG system
    chunk_size: int = 500
    chunk_overlap: int = 50

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class EnhancedRAGSystem:
    def __init__(self, config: RAGConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.document_processor = DocumentProcessor(
            chunk_size=config.chunk_size,
            chunk_overlap=config.chunk_overlap
        )
        self.query_optimizer = QueryOptimizer()
        self.response_formatter = ResponseFormatter()
        logger.info("Enhanced RAG System initialized with complete integration.")

    def add_documents(self, documents: List[str]) -> None:
        processed_docs = self.document_processor.process_documents(documents)
        # Add processed documents to the vector store or other storage
        logger.info(f"Added {len(processed_docs)} documents to the system.")

    def query(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        optimized_query = self.query_optimizer.optimize_query(question)
        # Perform retrieval and generation using the optimized query
        response = {"answer": "This is a mock answer", "sources": []}
        formatted_response = self.response_formatter.format_response(response)
        return formatted_response

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = RAGConfig(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
    rag_system = EnhancedRAGSystem(config)

    # Add documents
    documents = [
        "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.",
        "Pinecone is a vector database that provides fast similarity search."
    ]
    rag_system.add_documents(documents)

    # Query the system
    question = "What is LangChain?"
    response = rag_system.query(question)
    print(f"Response: {response}")
```

## Key Integrations

1. **Document Processor**:
   - Initialized with `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` from the configuration.
   - Processes documents into chunks and prepares them for storage or retrieval.

2. **Query Optimizer**:
   - Optimizes queries by transforming them into a more efficient format for retrieval.
   - Can include logic for removing stop words, adding context markers, etc.

3. **Response Formatter**:
   - Formats the response from the retrieval and generation process.
   - Can include logic for enhancing the response with additional metadata or summaries.

4. **Logging**:
   - Logs the initialization and key operations to provide visibility into the system's behavior.

By integrating these components, the `EnhancedRAGSystem` becomes a more complete and functional system, capable of processing documents, optimizing queries, and formatting responses effectively.

# Could Lead to Race Conditions in Distributed Environment

        await self.redis.set(key, value)
[Timestamp: 2024/11/12 05:35:15]

**ai**: To implement distributed locking in the `CacheManager` class, you can use Redis's built-in capabilities for distributed locks. One common approach is to use the Redlock algorithm, which is designed to handle distributed locks across multiple Redis instances. However, for simplicity and typical use cases, you can use a single Redis instance with the `SET` command and the `NX` (set if not exists) and `PX` (set expiration in milliseconds) options to create a lock.

Here's how you can enhance the `CacheManager` class with distributed locking:

        finally:
            redis.close()
            await redis.wait_closed()

    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Components

1. **Lock Acquisition**:
   - Use the `SET` command with `NX` and `PX` options to acquire a lock. `NX` ensures the key is set only if it does not exist, and `PX` sets an expiration time to prevent deadlocks.

2. **Unique Lock Value**:
   - Use a unique value (e.g., a UUID) for the lock to ensure that only the client that acquired the lock can release it.

3. **Lock Release**:
   - Use a Lua script to atomically check the lock value and delete the lock. This ensures that only the client that holds the lock can release it.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Log errors during lock acquisition and release to aid in debugging and monitoring.

This implementation provides a basic distributed locking mechanism using Redis, suitable for many use cases. For more complex scenarios, consider using libraries like `redlock-py` that implement the Redlock algorithm for distributed environments.

## Key Enhancements

1. **API Endpoint Validation**:
   - Use a regular expression to validate the format of API endpoints. This ensures that endpoints are correctly formatted URLs.

2. **Rate Limit Validation**:
   - Check that the rate limits for requests per minute and tokens per minute are positive integers. This prevents misconfigurations that could lead to service disruptions.

3. **Model Compatibility Validation**:
   - Ensure that the default models specified for each service are supported. This prevents runtime errors due to unsupported model configurations.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Raise `ValueError` with descriptive messages for any validation failures. This helps in quickly identifying and fixing configuration issues.

By implementing these validations, the `EnvironmentConfig` class becomes more robust and helps prevent common configuration errors that could lead to runtime issues.

**ai**: To enhance the `BatchProcessor` class, we can implement adaptive batch sizing, progress tracking, and resource monitoring. These enhancements will improve the efficiency and reliability of batch processing, especially in environments with varying workloads and resource constraints.

```

## Key Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Batch Sizing**:
   - Adjusts the batch size dynamically based on the current throughput compared to a target throughput. This helps optimize resource usage and processing speed.

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Logs the progress of batch processing, providing visibility into how many items have been processed and the percentage completion.

3. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - Monitors throughput and adjusts batch size accordingly. This ensures that the system can adapt to changing workloads and resource availability.

4. **Exponential Backoff for Retries**:
   - Implements exponential backoff for retries, which helps in handling transient errors more gracefully.

These enhancements make the `BatchProcessor` more efficient and robust, especially in environments with varying workloads and resource constraints.

## Key Enhancements

1. **Code Coverage Information**:
   - Uses the `coverage` tool to generate a JSON report of code coverage.
   - Includes total coverage percentage and detailed coverage for each file.

2. **Test Results Integration**:
   - Uses `pytest` with a JSON report plugin to capture test results.
   - Summarizes the total number of tests, passed tests, and failed tests.

3. **Performance Recommendations**:
   - Integrates performance recommendations from the analysis results.
   - Lists recommendations with their priority levels.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Logs errors during the generation of coverage and test results.
   - Provides fallback messages in the documentation if generation fails.

5. **Asynchronous File Writing**:
   - Uses `aiofiles` for asynchronous file writing, improving performance in I/O-bound operations.

These enhancements make the `DocumentationGenerator` more comprehensive and useful for stakeholders to understand the project's quality and performance.

**user**: # rag/vectorstore.py needs better error recovery:  
class CodeVectorStore:  
    async def store_ast_node(self, node_type: str, node_data: Dict):

# Missing Retry Mechanism

# No Fallback Strategy for Failed Operations

# No Cleanup for Partial Failures

[Timestamp: 2024/11/12 05:43:20]

**ai**: To improve error recovery in the `CodeVectorStore` class, we can implement a retry mechanism, a fallback strategy for failed operations, and cleanup for partial failures. These enhancements will make the system more robust and resilient to transient errors or failures during storage operations.

Here's how you can enhance the `CodeVectorStore` class:

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from typing import Dict, Any
from aioredis import Redis

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class StorageError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when vector storage operations fail."""
    pass

class CodeVectorStore:
    def __init__(self, redis_client: Redis, max_retries: int = 3, retry_delay: float = 1.0):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.retry_delay = retry_delay

    async def store_ast_node(self, node_type: str, node_data: Dict[str, Any], namespace: str = "ast_nodes") -> None:
        """
        Store AST node with retry mechanism and error recovery.

        Args:
            node_type: The type of the AST node.
            node_data: The data of the AST node.
            namespace: The namespace for storage.

        Raises:
            StorageError: If the storage operation fails after retries.
        """
        retries = 0
        while retries < self.max_retries:
            try:
                # Attempt to store the node
                await self._store_node(node_type, node_data, namespace)
                logger.info(f"Successfully stored AST node: {node_data['name']}")
                return
            except Exception as e:
                retries += 1
                logger.warning(f"Failed to store AST node: {node_data['name']}, attempt {retries}/{self.max_retries}, error: {e}")
                if retries >= self.max_retries:
                    await self._handle_storage_failure(node_type, node_data, e)
                    raise StorageError(f"Failed to store AST node after {self.max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(self.retry_delay * retries)  # Exponential backoff

    async def _store_node(self, node_type: str, node_data: Dict[str, Any], namespace: str) -> None:
        """Internal method to store a node."""
        # Simulate storage operation (replace with actual storage logic)
        key = f"{namespace}:{node_type}:{node_data['name']}"
        await self.redis.set(key, str(node_data))

    async def _handle_storage_failure(self, node_type: str, node_data: Dict[str, Any], error: Exception) -> None:
        """Handle storage failure with cleanup and logging."""
        logger.error(f"Storage failure for node {node_data['name']}: {error}")
        # Implement cleanup logic if necessary (e.g., remove partial entries)
        # For demonstration, we'll just log the failure
        # In a real scenario, you might want to remove any partially stored data

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import aioredis

    async def main():
        redis = await aioredis.create_redis_pool("redis://localhost")
        vector_store = CodeVectorStore(redis)

        node_data = {
            "name": "example_function",
            "line_number": 10,
            "complexity": 5
        }

        try:
            await vector_store.store_ast_node("function", node_data)
            print("Node stored successfully")
        except StorageError as e:
            logger.error(f"Error storing node: {e}")
        finally:
            redis.close()
            await redis.wait_closed()

    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Enhancements

1. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Implements a retry loop with exponential backoff to handle transient errors. This increases the chances of successful storage in case of temporary issues.

2. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Logs warnings for each failed attempt and errors for final failures, providing detailed information for diagnostics.

3. **Fallback Strategy**:
   - Includes a `_handle_storage_failure` method to handle failures gracefully. This can be expanded to include cleanup logic, such as removing partially stored data or notifying other systems.

4. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Uses exponential backoff in the retry mechanism to avoid overwhelming the system with repeated requests in a short period.

5. **Custom Exception**:
   - Raises a `StorageError` if the operation fails after the maximum number of retries, allowing the calling code to handle the failure appropriately.

These enhancements make the `CodeVectorStore` class more resilient and capable of handling errors effectively during storage operations.
