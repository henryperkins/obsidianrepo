## Enhancing AI Context Windows for DocScribe

Understanding the project's goal of enhancing AI context windows significantly clarifies the direction for feature implementation. Your roadmap and emphasis on key values are excellent. Here's how we can refine the action plan and feature implementation, incorporating DocScribe's core purpose:

### Refined Action Plan and Feature Implementation

**Guiding Principles:**

- **Context is King:** Design features to maximize relevant information within the AI's context window.
- **Discreet Enhancement:** Ensure DocScribe operates seamlessly in the background with minimal developer intervention.
- **Universal Applicability:** Target diverse applications, not just AI-specific tools.

### Phase 1: Context-Aware Chunking and Hierarchical Documentation

**Objective:** Create a system for representing code and documentation in manageable, contextually rich chunks.

**Actions:**

1. **Semantic Chunking:** Enhance the `chunk_code` function to consider semantic relationships:
   - **Function Calls:** Include the called function's signature and docstring in the current chunk.
   - **Variable Definitions:** Include the definition of a variable where it's first used.
   - **Cross-File Context:** Summarize relevant code from other files when referenced.

2. **Hierarchical Context Manager:** Store both code and documentation chunks for efficient retrieval. Add methods like `get_documentation_for_function`.

3. **Context Relevance Scoring:** Implement a scoring system to prioritize chunks based on:
   - **Recency:** More recently accessed chunks are likely more relevant.
   - **Frequency:** Frequently accessed chunks are important.
   - **Semantic Similarity:** Use embeddings or keywords to determine similarity to the current code.

### Phase 2: Token Limit Management and Dynamic Context

**Objective:** Optimize token usage and dynamically manage the context window to maximize relevant information.

**Actions:**

1. **Contextual Summarization:** Prioritize summarization based on context relevance scores, summarizing less relevant chunks more aggressively.

2. **Dynamic Context Window Adjustment:** Implement algorithms to adjust the context window based on:
   - **AI Feedback:** Add more relevant chunks if the AI signals insufficient context.
   - **Developer Activity:** Update the context window when developers switch codebase parts.

3. **Context Window History:** Maintain a history for efficient backtracking and context switching.

### Phase 3: Incremental Context and Multi-Language Support

**Objective:** Enable efficient updates and ensure DocScribe works seamlessly across languages.

**Actions:**

1. **Incremental Updates:** Use a fine-grained approach to updates, modifying only the chunks related to a changed function.

2. **Multi-Language Support:** Standardize context representation across languages for cross-language retrieval and summarization.

### Phase 4: Caching, Prioritization, and Cross-Context Integration

**Objective:** Optimize performance and further enhance context management.

**Actions:**

1. **Contextual Caching:** Cache combinations of frequently used chunks.

2. **Selective Retention and Prioritization:** Implement a scoring system that learns from developer behavior and AI feedback.

3. **Cross-Context Summarization:** Develop techniques to summarize context across different hierarchy levels.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features and Integration

**Objective:** Expand DocScribe's capabilities and integrate it into development workflows.

**Actions:**

1. **AI Model-Specific Optimizations:** Explore optimizations for specific AI models, like different summarization techniques.

2. **User Interface:** Focus on context visualization and control, allowing developers to inspect and adjust context relevance.

**Key Changes and Rationale:**

- **Focus on Context Relevance:** Emphasize scoring and prioritizing chunks based on relevance.
- **Deeper Integration with AI:** Use AI feedback to dynamically adjust the context window.
- **Multi-Language Standardization:** Ensure universal applicability by standardizing context representation.
- **Re-evaluation of Code Growth Prediction:** De-prioritize features not directly related to context management.

By focusing on these core principles and the revised action plan, DocScribe can become a powerful and versatile tool for enhancing AI context windows in any application. Remember to iterate, test, and gather feedback throughout the development process.
