**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Technology Sales Specialist position at IBM, as advertised on your careers page. With over a decade of experience in sales, customer service, and technical support, coupled with a deep passion for artificial intelligence and cloud computing, I am confident in my ability to contribute to IBM's mission of delivering cutting-edge technology solutions to clients.

In my previous role as a Manager at Sodexo, I successfully managed a high-volume retail location, consistently achieving and surpassing sales targets. I implemented sales strategies that led to a 15% increase in revenue and enhanced customer satisfaction by focusing on service excellence. My ability to build strong customer relationships and understand client needs has been a cornerstone of my success in sales roles.

As an Independent Technology Consultant, I have combined my sales expertise with technical knowledge to provide tailored solutions to clients. I have developed AI-inspired scripts and web applications using platforms like Hugging Face, Vertex AI, and Azure AI. This hands-on experience with AI technologies aligns with IBM's focus on innovation and delivering value through technology.

My background also includes a role as a Sales Associate at Micro Center, where I exceeded sales targets by providing expert product recommendations and conducting needs assessments. My technical support experience at Automattic, Inc. as a Happiness Engineer has honed my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences, a skill that is crucial for a Technology Sales Specialist.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Organizational Leadership at Arizona State University and the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. My coursework in sales strategies and organizational communication has equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in a sales environment that demands both technical knowledge and interpersonal excellence.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join IBM because of its reputation as a leader in AI and cloud computing. The chance to leverage my sales experience, technical expertise, and passion for AI to help clients achieve their business objectives is incredibly motivating.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with your needs and how I can contribute to IBM's success as a Technology Sales Specialist.

Sincerely,

Henry Perkins
