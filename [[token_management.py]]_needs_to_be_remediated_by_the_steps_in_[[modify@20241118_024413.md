# [token_management.py](token_management.py.md)*needs_to_be_remediated_by_the_steps_in*[[modify@20241118_024413

**user**: [token_management.py](simple2/token_management.py.md) needs to be remediated by the steps in [modify token management](modify%20token%20management.md)

**ai**: To remediate the `token_management.py` file according to the steps outlined in the `modify token management` instructions, we need to address the type mismatch issue in the `get_usage_stats` method of the `TokenManager` class. Here's how you can implement the changes:

## Step-by-Step Remediation

1. **Identify the Issue:**  
   The `get_usage_stats` method is annotated to return `Dict[str, int]`, but the values might be floats due to arithmetic operations. We need to ensure the return type matches the actual data type.

2. **Choose a Solution:**
   - If the token counts (`total_prompt_tokens` and `total_completion_tokens`) can be fractional, update the return type annotation to include `float`.
   - If they should always be integers, convert them to `int` before returning.

3. **Implement the Solution:**  
   Based on the context provided, let's assume the token counts should always be integers. We will convert the values to `int` before returning them.

## Updated Code

Here's the updated `get_usage_stats` method:

```python
def get_usage_stats(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Get current token usage statistics.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Total prompt and completion tokens.
    """
    return {
        "total_prompt_tokens": int(self.total_prompt_tokens),
        "total_completion_tokens": int(self.total_completion_tokens)
    }
```

## Explanation

- **Type Conversion:** We use `int()` to ensure that `total_prompt_tokens` and `total_completion_tokens` are integers when returned. This resolves the type mismatch issue.
- **Docstring Update:** The docstring remains accurate since we are enforcing integer values.

## Additional Considerations

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Ensure that any arithmetic operations involving these token counts maintain integer types. If any operation can result in a float, explicitly convert the result to an integer.
- **Testing:** After making these changes, test the method to ensure it behaves as expected and that no type errors occur during execution.

By following these steps, you ensure that the `get_usage_stats` method aligns with its type annotations and the intended data types, maintaining consistency and preventing runtime errors.
