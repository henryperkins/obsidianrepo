**user**: Explain how to use function calling and structured outputs using the Azure OpenAI Service API as reference
[Timestamp: 2024/12/18 00:01:09]

**ai**: Function calling and structured outputs are powerful features of the Azure OpenAI Service API that enable models to interact with external tools or generate responses in a structured format. Here's a detailed explanation of how to use these features:

---

## **1. Function Calling**

### **What is Function Calling?**
Function calling allows the model to generate JSON inputs for predefined functions. This enables the model to interact with external tools, APIs, or systems by generating structured data that can be passed to these tools.

---

### **How to Use Function Calling**

#### **Step 1: Define Functions**
You need to define the functions that the model can call. Each function includes:
- **`name`**: The name of the function.
- **`description`**: A description of what the function does.
- **`parameters`**: A JSON Schema object defining the function's input structure.

Example:
```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "description": "Get the current weather for a given location.",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The city and state, e.g., San Francisco, CA."
          },
          "unit": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
            "description": "The temperature unit."
          }
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Specify the Tool Choice**
Use the `tools` field in the request to provide the list of functions the model can call. You can also control whether the model must call a function or generate a message using the `tool_choice` parameter.

Example:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in New York?" }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": { "type": "string" },
            "unit": { "type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"] }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto"
}
```

---

#### **Step 3: Handle the Model's Response**
The model will generate a response indicating the function to call and the arguments to pass. The response will include:
- **`tool_calls`**: An array of tool calls generated by the model.
- **`function`**: The name of the function and its arguments.

Example Response:
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "id": "tool_call_1",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
              "name": "get_weather",
              "arguments": "{ \"location\": \"New York\", \"unit\": \"celsius\" }"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **Step 4: Execute the Function**
Once you receive the function name and arguments, execute the function in your system and return the result to the model.

Example Function Execution:
```python
def get_weather(location, unit):
    # Example implementation
    return f"The weather in {location} is 20 degrees {unit}."

# Extract arguments from the response
args = {"location": "New York", "unit": "celsius"}
result = get_weather(**args)
```

---

#### **Step 5: Provide the Result Back to the Model**
Send the result back to the model as a new message in the conversation.

Example:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in New York?" },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "tool_call_1",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "arguments": "{ \"location\": \"New York\", \"unit\": \"celsius\" }"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    { "role": "tool", "content": "The weather in New York is 20 degrees celsius." }
  ]
}
```

---

## **2. Structured Outputs**

### **What are Structured Outputs?**
Structured outputs ensure that the model generates responses in a predefined JSON format. This is useful when you need the model's output to adhere to a specific schema for downstream processing.

---

### **How to Use Structured Outputs**

#### **Step 1: Define the JSON Schema**
Use the `response_format` field to specify the output format. For structured outputs, set the `type` to `json_schema` and provide the JSON Schema.

Example:
```json
{
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "weather_response",
      "description": "The response format for weather information.",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "temperature": { "type": "number", "description": "The temperature value." },
          "unit": { "type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"] },
          "condition": { "type": "string", "description": "The weather condition." }
        },
        "required": ["temperature", "unit", "condition"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Instruct the Model**
Provide clear instructions in the `messages` field to guide the model to generate output in the specified format.

Example:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a weather assistant. Provide responses in JSON format." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?" }
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "weather_response",
      "description": "The response format for weather information.",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "temperature": { "type": "number" },
          "unit": { "type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"] },
          "condition": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["temperature", "unit", "condition"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### **Step 3: Handle the Model's Response**
The model will generate a response that adheres to the specified JSON Schema.

Example Response:
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": {
          "temperature": 18,
          "unit": "celsius",
          "condition": "sunny"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Validate JSON Outputs**: Always validate the model's output against the schema to ensure correctness.
2. **Use Clear Instructions**: Provide explicit instructions in the `system` message to guide the model.
3. **Combine Features**: You can use function calling and structured outputs together for more complex workflows.

[Timestamp: 2024/12/18 00:03:25]

**user**: Does the structured ouitputs with azure openai provide everything there is to know on the api usage for function calling and structured outputs ?
[Timestamp: 2024/12/18 00:03:56]

**ai**: The **[Structured Outputs with Azure OpenAI](./Structured%20Outputs%20with%20Azure%20OpenAI.md)** guidance provides a comprehensive overview of using **function calling** and **structured outputs** with the Azure OpenAI Service API. However, while it covers the key concepts, practical examples, and use cases, there are a few **additional details and nuances** in the API documentation that could further enhance understanding and usage. Here's an analysis of what is covered and what might still be missing:

---

### **What the Guidance Covers Well**
1. **Core Concepts**
   - It explains the `response_format` parameter (`json_object` and `json_schema`) and how to use it effectively.
   - It covers how to define tools (functions) with JSON schemas and how the model generates structured inputs for those tools.

2. **Practical Examples**
   - The guidance provides clear examples for:
     - Defining `response_format` (both `json_object` and `json_schema`).
     - Specifying tools with JSON schemas.
     - Submitting tool outputs back to the model.
     - Combining function calling with structured outputs.

3. **Best Practices**
   - It emphasizes the importance of:
     - Providing clear instructions in the `messages` field.
     - Validating outputs against schemas.
     - Using `strict` mode for schema adherence.

4. **Use Cases**
   - The guidance outlines practical applications, such as API responses, data pipelines, and task automation, which are highly relevant.

---

### **What Might Be Missing or Could Be Expanded**
While the guidance is robust, the following details from the API documentation could be added to make it even more complete:

---

#### **1. Advanced Features of Function Calling**
- **Parallel Tool Calls**: 
  - The API supports **parallel tool calls** using the `parallel_tool_calls` parameter. This allows the model to call multiple tools simultaneously, which can improve efficiency in workflows involving multiple functions.
  - Example:
    ```json
    "parallel_tool_calls": true
    ```

- **Tool Choice Options**:
  - The `tool_choice` parameter allows fine-grained control over how the model decides to call tools:
    - `none`: The model will not call any tools.
    - `auto`: The model decides whether to call a tool or generate a message.
    - `required`: The model must call one or more tools.
    - Example:
      ```json
      "tool_choice": "auto"
      ```

---

#### **2. Streaming Responses**
- The API supports **streaming responses** for both structured outputs and function calling. This is useful for real-time applications where partial results are needed as they are generated.
- Example:
  ```json
  "stream": true
  ```

- **Stream Options**:
  - The `stream_options` parameter allows customization of the streaming behavior, such as including token usage statistics in the final stream chunk.

---

#### **3. Handling Errors and Edge Cases**
- **Error Handling**:
  - The API provides detailed error responses for invalid schemas, malformed requests, or tool execution failures. Including examples of error handling in the guidance would be helpful.
  - Example Error:
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "InvalidSchema",
        "message": "The provided JSON schema is invalid."
      }
    }
    ```

- **Incomplete Outputs**:
  - The API may return incomplete outputs if token limits are exceeded or if a tool fails. The `incomplete_details` field in the response provides information about why the output is incomplete.

---

#### **4. Schema Validation and Limitations**
- **Schema Validation**:
  - While the guidance mentions validation, it could expand on how to validate outputs programmatically using JSON Schema libraries in various programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript).

- **Schema Limitations**:
  - The API supports a subset of JSON Schema features when `strict` mode is enabled. For example:
    - Supported: `type`, `properties`, `required`, `enum`, etc.
    - Not Supported: Complex features like `oneOf`, `anyOf`, or `$ref`.

---

#### **5. Tool Output Submission**
- The guidance mentions submitting tool outputs but does not provide details on:
  - How to handle multiple tool outputs in a single request.
  - How to handle cases where the model requires additional inputs after receiving the tool's output.

---

#### **6. Combining Function Calling and Structured Outputs**
- While the guidance explains combining these features, it could provide more complex examples, such as:
  - A workflow where the model calls multiple tools, processes their outputs, and generates a structured response.
  - Using structured outputs (`json_schema`) as inputs for subsequent tool calls.

---

#### **7. Token Usage and Limits**
- The API documentation specifies token limits for prompts and completions. The guidance could include:
  - How to calculate token usage for structured outputs and function calls.
  - How to use the `max_prompt_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` parameters to control token usage.

---

#### **8. Advanced Use Cases**
- The guidance could include additional advanced use cases, such as:
  - **Chained Tool Calls**: Using the output of one tool as the input for another.
  - **Dynamic Schema Generation**: Adjusting the schema dynamically based on user input.
  - **Custom Validation**: Implementing custom validation logic for tool outputs before submitting them to the model.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **[Structured Outputs with Azure OpenAI](./Structured%20Outputs%20with%20Azure%20OpenAI.md)** guidance provides an excellent foundation for understanding and using function calling and structured outputs. However, to make it truly exhaustive, it could include:
- Advanced features like parallel tool calls, streaming, and tool choice options.
- Error handling, schema limitations, and token usage details.
- More complex workflows and advanced use cases.

If you'd like, I can help expand the guidance to include these additional details or provide specific examples for any of the points mentioned above! ðŸ˜Š

# **Structured Outputs and Function Calling with Azure OpenAI**

The Azure OpenAI Service API provides powerful features like **structured outputs** and **function calling** to enhance the capabilities of your applications. These features allow you to enforce structured responses, interact with external tools, and build robust workflows.

This guide will cover **everything you need to know** about using structured outputs and function calling effectively, with examples and best practices.

---

## **1. Structured Outputs**

### **What Are Structured Outputs?**
Structured outputs ensure that the model generates responses in a predefined format, such as JSON objects or JSON schemas. This is particularly useful for applications that require reliable, machine-readable responses.

---

### **How to Use Structured Outputs**

#### **Step 1: Set the `response_format` Parameter**
The `response_format` parameter specifies the desired output structure. The API supports two options:
1. **`json_object`**: Ensures the model generates valid JSON output.
2. **`json_schema`**: Ensures the model's output adheres to a predefined JSON schema.

---

#### **Step 2: Define the `response_format` in the Request**

##### **For `json_object`:**
```json
"response_format": {
  "type": "json_object"
}
```

##### **For `json_schema`:**
```json
"response_format": {
  "type": "json_schema",
  "json_schema": {
    "name": "example_schema",
    "description": "A schema for structured output",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email"
        }
      },
      "required": ["name", "age"]
    },
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

- **`type`**: Specifies the format (`json_object` or `json_schema`).
- **`name`**: A unique name for the schema.
- **`description`**: A brief description of the schema's purpose.
- **`schema`**: The JSON schema definition, following the [JSON Schema Standard](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/).
- **`strict`**: If `true`, the model strictly adheres to the schema.

---

#### **Step 3: Instruct the Model to Use the Format**
Provide clear instructions in the `messages` parameter to guide the model to generate structured outputs.

Example:
```json
"messages": [
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are an assistant that provides responses in JSON format. Ensure all responses are valid JSON."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Please provide a JSON object with my name, age, and email."
  }
]
```

---

#### **Step 4: Validate the Output**
- **For `json_object`**: The model ensures the output is valid JSON.
- **For `json_schema`**: The model guarantees the output conforms to the specified schema.

---

#### **Step 5: Example Request**
Hereâ€™s a complete example using `json_schema`:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates structured JSON responses."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Provide a JSON object with my name, age, and email."
    }
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "user_info",
      "description": "A schema for user information",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "age": {
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "email": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "email"
          }
        },
        "required": ["name", "age", "email"]
      },
      "strict": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### **Step 6: Example Response**
The model will generate a response like this:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

---

### **Benefits of Structured Outputs**
- **Validation**: Ensures responses are always in the expected format.
- **Reliability**: Reduces the chances of malformed or incomplete responses.
- **Integration**: Simplifies integration with downstream systems that consume structured data.

---

### **Advanced Features of Structured Outputs**

#### **Streaming Responses**
- Enable streaming with the `stream` parameter to receive partial responses in real-time.
- Example:
  ```json
  "stream": true
  ```

#### **Schema Limitations**
- The API supports a subset of JSON Schema features when `strict` mode is enabled.
  - Supported: `type`, `properties`, `required`, `enum`, etc.
  - Not Supported: Complex features like `oneOf`, `anyOf`, or `$ref`.

#### **Token Usage**
- Use the `max_prompt_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` parameters to control token usage for structured outputs.

## **2. Function Calling**

### **What is Function Calling?**
Function calling allows the model to interact with external tools or APIs by generating structured inputs for predefined functions. This enables workflows like retrieving data, performing calculations, or automating tasks.

---

### **How to Use Function Calling**

#### **Step 1: Define Functions**
Define the functions the model can call using the `tools` parameter. Each function includes:
- **`name`**: The function's name.
- **`description`**: A description of what the function does.
- **`parameters`**: A JSON Schema defining the function's input structure.

Example:
```json
"tools": [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "description": "Retrieve the current weather for a given city.",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "city": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The name of the city to get the weather for."
          },
          "unit": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["Celsius", "Fahrenheit"],
            "description": "The unit for temperature."
          }
        },
        "required": ["city"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

---

#### **Step 2: Guide the Model to Use the Tool**
Use the `messages` parameter to instruct the model to call the tool when appropriate.

Example:
```json
"messages": [
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Use the `get_weather` function to retrieve weather information when asked about the weather."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What is the weather in Paris?"
  }
]
```

---

#### **Step 3: Handle the Model's Response**
The model generates a structured input for the tool.

Example Response:
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "tool_call_123",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": {
          "city": "Paris",
          "unit": "Celsius"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **Step 4: Submit Tool Outputs**
After executing the tool, submit the output back to the model using the `/submit_tool_outputs` endpoint.

Example:
```json
{
  "tool_outputs": [
    {
      "tool_call_id": "tool_call_123",
      "output": {
        "temperature": "22Â°C",
        "condition": "Sunny"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **Step 5: Model Incorporates Tool Outputs**
The model integrates the tool's output into the conversation.

Example:
```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "The current weather in Paris is 22Â°C and sunny."
}
```

---

### **Advanced Features of Function Calling**

#### **Parallel Tool Calls**
Enable parallel tool calls using the `parallel_tool_calls` parameter.
```json
"parallel_tool_calls": true
```

#### **Tool Choice Options**
Control how the model decides to call tools using the `tool_choice` parameter:
- `none`: The model will not call any tools.
- `auto`: The model decides whether to call a tool or generate a message.
- `required`: The model must call one or more tools.

Example:
```json
"tool_choice": "auto"
```

---

### **Combining Function Calling with Structured Outputs**
You can combine function calling and structured outputs to create powerful workflows. For example:
1. Use structured outputs (`json_schema`) to define the tool's input and output formats.
2. Guide the model to call tools and validate their outputs.

---

## **3. Use Cases**

### **Structured Outputs**
- **APIs**: Returning structured data for API responses.
- **Data Pipelines**: Ensuring compatibility with data processing systems.
- **Applications**: Generating structured inputs for forms or workflows.

### **Function Calling**
- **Weather Retrieval**: Use a weather API to provide real-time updates.
- **Database Queries**: Fetch structured data from a database.
- **Task Automation**: Automate workflows by calling external APIs.
