To manage context windows and token limits in real-time while interacting with an AI model, you can automate several key strategies like summarization, chunking, and hierarchical context management. Below is a high-level approach, focusing on techniques for handling dynamic content, ensuring you stay within token limits, and maximizing model responsiveness.

### 1. **Dynamic Summarization and Compression**

   - **Adaptive Summarization:** Implement a pipeline that summarizes content based on priority and relevance. For example:
     - Use shorter, high-level summaries for background information and longer, detailed summaries for critical context.
     - Summarize prior interactions when the conversation history exceeds a threshold. You can adjust the length based on token space available.
   - **Summarization API:** Use your model's summarization capabilities to auto-summarize sections as they exceed token thresholds.
   - **Layered Summaries:** Implement hierarchical summaries. Create detailed summaries of sections, then compress them further into high-level summaries. Retrieve deeper levels only as needed.

### 2. **Context Chunking and Hierarchical Management**

   - **Smart Chunking:** Split large documents or code files into logical chunks (e.g., by function, class, or paragraph). Use chunk metadata (like titles, keywords) to help the model understand each chunk’s context.
   - **Hierarchical Context Windows:** Structure your chunks hierarchically, where higher-priority chunks are always included, and lower-priority chunks are added only when token limits permit. 
   - **Dynamic Chunk Retrieval:** Tag chunks with keywords and allow the model to pull in relevant chunks dynamically based on the prompt. For example:
     - Use an embedding-based similarity search to retrieve only the most relevant chunks.
     - Update the chunk priority dynamically, giving preference to recent or contextually relevant information.

### 3. **Real-Time Context Management**

   - **Sliding Window Approach:** Implement a sliding window that retains only the most recent and relevant context. For ongoing tasks, keep a set window size and adjust the content within that window based on relevance.
   - **Token Balancing with Multi-Tier Context:** Divide the tokens among different levels of information (e.g., immediate context, project context, historical context). Update each tier’s content based on the conversation’s flow.
   - **Memory Cache:** Develop a cache for context retrieval where the model can access recent interactions without fully including them in the prompt each time.

### 4. **Automating Chunk Selection and Summarization**

   - **Context-aware Pre-processing**: Write a script that automatically analyzes the user input or output and decides the context needed, pulling from hierarchical summaries, recent interactions, or chunks in real time.
   - **Token Monitor:** Track token usage and adjust the included content based on available token space. If the token limit is close, the script can trim context by removing low-priority information or compressing previous interactions into a summary.
   - **Async Context Update:** Set up an asynchronous process that monitors interaction in real-time, preemptively adjusting context and summaries as new interactions occur.

### Sample Code Outline for Real-Time Context Window Management

Here's a code outline in Python that uses a combination of chunking, summarization, and dynamic retrieval to maintain an optimized context window.

```python
import openai
from transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer  # Assuming you're using OpenAI's model
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize components
tokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained("openai-gpt")
embed_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Summarization Function
def summarize_content(content, model="gpt-4"):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": content}],
        temperature=0.3,
        max_tokens=100,
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Embedding-based Chunk Retrieval
def retrieve_relevant_chunks(query, chunks):
    query_embed = embed_model.encode([query])
    chunk_embeds = embed_model.encode(chunks)
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embed, chunk_embeds).flatten()
    top_chunks = [chunks[i] for i in similarities.argsort()[-3:][::-1]]
    return top_chunks

# Real-time Context Manager
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, token_limit=4096, base_context=""):
        self.token_limit = token_limit
        self.base_context = base_context
        self.context_window = []
        
    def add_to_context(self, content, is_summary=False):
        tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(content))
        
        # Check if adding the new content exceeds the limit
        if tokens + self.current_token_count() > self.token_limit:
            self.reduce_context(tokens)
            
        self.context_window.append(content)

    def current_token_count(self):
        return sum(len(tokenizer.encode(c)) for c in self.context_window)

    def reduce_context(self, tokens_needed):
        # Remove oldest chunks or summarize until space is freed
        while self.current_token_count() + tokens_needed > self.token_limit:
            if not self.context_window:
                break
            # Pop or summarize
            if len(self.context_window) > 1:
                self.context_window.pop(0)
            else:
                self.context_window[0] = summarize_content(self.context_window[0])

    def get_context(self):
        return " ".join(self.context_window)

# Example of usage
context_manager = ContextManager()

query = "How can I implement real-time token management?"
chunks = ["Chunk1: Details of previous interactions", "Chunk2: Another part", "..."]

# Add most relevant chunks to the context
relevant_chunks = retrieve_relevant_chunks(query, chunks)
for chunk in relevant_chunks:
    context_manager.add_to_context(chunk)

# Generate model response
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": context_manager.get_context() + query}]
)
```

### Additional Tips

- **Event-driven Summarization**: Summarize recent interactions when a topic changes.
- **Keyword-based Chunk Prioritization**: Use keywords in queries to prioritize specific chunks over others, allowing dynamic chunk selection.
- **Automated Context Reset**: When moving to a new topic or project, reset the context window and start with the new relevant context.

By combining these techniques, you can automate real-time context and token management, ensuring the model receives the optimal amount of information for each interaction without manual adjustments.

For managing context windows and token limits specifically during app development in large codebases, you can leverage strategies tailored to handle extensive files, modular code structures, and continuous interaction. Here’s how to optimize real-time context management for large-scale app development:

### 1. **Modular Code Chunking Based on Code Structure**

   - **Code-based Chunking**: Segment code into logical units like classes, functions, or modules. This way, you can load only the relevant parts of the codebase based on current interactions.
   - **Dependency Mapping**: Build a map of dependencies (e.g., class-to-method relationships) to fetch related code segments as needed. If the user is modifying a method, fetch its associated classes and imports for context.
   - **Smart Chunk Retrieval by File and Function**: Tag each chunk with metadata, like file name, function name, and purpose, to enable fast retrieval.

### 2. **Dynamic Code Summarization**

   - **Function-level Summarization**: Summarize individual functions or methods to provide concise descriptions for each. These can be added to a hierarchical summary tree, ensuring you retain details without loading full code.
   - **Code Comments Parsing**: Extract and utilize docstrings, comments, and function summaries to generate a high-level overview. This can help contextualize without loading large code blocks.
   - **Real-Time Summarization Pipeline**: Build a pipeline that summarizes code when token limits are approached, ensuring lower-priority information is compressed into summaries.

### 3. **Context-Aware File Loading**

   - **Keyword-based Retrieval**: Dynamically retrieve code chunks by matching keywords in user queries (like function names or variable names) to code segments.
   - **Dependency-aware Context Expansion**: Load related dependencies as users drill down into specific areas of code. For example, if they are working on a particular API endpoint, load relevant request handlers, validation functions, and responses.
   - **Pre-caching Common Modules**: Identify commonly used modules (e.g., config files, utility functions) and keep them in memory as a "core" context to avoid frequent reloading.

### 4. **Hierarchical Context Windows for Large Codebases**

   - **Layered Context**: Prioritize context layers, such as immediate code (function user is working on), related functions or classes, and general project context. Include lower layers only if token space allows.
   - **Sliding Context Window**: Implement a sliding window that retains only recent interactions and relevant code changes. As users move between files or functions, maintain context of recent edits and changes dynamically.
   - **Issue or Feature Focused Context**: Load code context relevant to current feature development or bug fixes, particularly when you know the user is addressing specific issues or sections.

### Sample Implementation for Code-based Context Management

Here’s a sample code structure that implements context management for large codebases during development.

```python
import openai
from transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize components
tokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained("openai-gpt")
embed_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Function to summarize code snippets
def summarize_code_snippet(code):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize the following code:\n{code}"}],
        max_tokens=50
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Context manager for codebases
class CodeContextManager:
    def __init__(self, token_limit=4096):
        self.token_limit = token_limit
        self.context = []
        self.recent_code = []
        
    def add_code_chunk(self, code_chunk, metadata=None):
        tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(code_chunk))
        
        # Summarize and reduce if adding chunk exceeds limit
        if tokens + self.current_token_count() > self.token_limit:
            self.reduce_context(tokens)
        
        # Add summarized version if too large
        if tokens > self.token_limit / 4:  # adjust threshold as needed
            summary = summarize_code_snippet(code_chunk)
            self.context.append({"content": summary, "metadata": metadata, "type": "summary"})
        else:
            self.context.append({"content": code_chunk, "metadata": metadata, "type": "code"})

    def retrieve_relevant_chunks(self, query):
        # Encode and retrieve relevant chunks based on query
        query_embed = embed_model.encode([query])
        chunk_embeds = embed_model.encode([chunk["content"] for chunk in self.context])
        similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embed, chunk_embeds).flatten()
        
        top_chunks = [self.context[i] for i in similarities.argsort()[-3:][::-1]]
        return top_chunks

    def current_token_count(self):
        return sum(len(tokenizer.encode(chunk["content"])) for chunk in self.context)

    def reduce_context(self, tokens_needed):
        while self.current_token_count() + tokens_needed > self.token_limit:
            if not self.context:
                break
            if self.context[0]["type"] == "code":
                self.context[0] = {
                    "content": summarize_code_snippet(self.context[0]["content"]),
                    "metadata": self.context[0]["metadata"],
                    "type": "summary",
                }
            else:
                self.context.pop(0)

    def get_context(self):
        return " ".join(chunk["content"] for chunk in self.context)

# Example usage
context_manager = CodeContextManager()

# Suppose we have code chunks based on the user's navigation in the codebase
code_chunk = """
def process_request(data):
    # Process incoming data
    validated = validate_data(data)
    result = perform_operation(validated)
    return format_result(result)
"""

context_manager.add_code_chunk(code_chunk, metadata={"function": "process_request", "file": "api_handler.py"})
query = "How does request processing work?"

# Retrieve relevant context based on query
relevant_chunks = context_manager.retrieve_relevant_chunks(query)
context_window = context_manager.get_context()

# Generate response with relevant context
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": context_window + query}]
)
```

### Additional Best Practices

- **Index Codebase for Fast Retrieval**: Build a lightweight index of the codebase to speed up chunk retrieval based on function, file, or class name.
- **Function Call Trees**: For projects with complex dependencies, use call trees or dependency graphs to determine which parts of the codebase are required for context dynamically.
- **Version Control Integration**: Integrate with Git to track recent changes or code diffs, giving higher priority to modified or recently committed code chunks.

By structuring your context window this way, you can effectively manage large codebases in real-time without exceeding token limits, keeping your interactions focused and relevant.

Yes, the model can be guided to recognize missing information and retrieve it effectively through a combination of prompt engineering, automated metadata tagging, and dependency tracking. This approach allows the model to identify gaps in context based on the requested output, thus helping it determine when and where to retrieve additional code or documentation dynamically.

Here’s how you can set up a system that enables the model to be context-aware about missing information:

### 1. **Dependency and Metadata Tagging**

   - **Metadata-based Context Identification**: Annotate each code chunk with metadata that includes information like file name, function or class name, dependencies, and purpose. This helps the model recognize the source of code or data it needs to retrieve.
   - **Tagging Dependencies**: Map dependencies between functions, classes, and modules. For instance, if a function calls `validate_data`, the metadata should indicate that `process_request` depends on `validate_data`. This way, if the model sees a gap related to `validate_data`, it can look up that function specifically.
   - **Prompt with Dependency Hints**: Use hints within prompts, such as “Check related functions or imports,” to tell the model it can pull in dependencies if needed. This cue can also be automated by checking if the prompt contains terms that indicate dependencies, like function calls or object instantiations not defined in the current context.

### 2. **Embedding-based Retrieval for Relevant Context**

   - **Context-aware Similarity Retrieval**: Encode each function, class, or code snippet as embeddings. When the model identifies a missing part, it can query for the most similar code blocks or documentation based on keywords, method names, or structure to pull in relevant context.
   - **Automated Similarity Matching on Missing Terms**: If a prompt includes a method or class the model doesn’t recognize, your system can automatically perform an embedding-based similarity search across the codebase to retrieve the most relevant definitions.

### 3. **Prompt Engineering for Context Awareness**

   - **Use Error-checking Patterns**: Structure prompts to include phrases that encourage the model to verify dependencies or check for missing context. For example:
     - *“If additional dependencies are needed, list them before generating the response.”*
     - *“Identify any undefined variables, functions, or classes and suggest retrieval sources.”*
   - **Highlight Key Terms for Reference**: Clearly specify references in the prompt (e.g., *“Use `validate_data` function if required”*), making it clear to the model which parts are relevant. This can guide the model to recognize terms it doesn’t yet understand or retrieve definitions for.

### 4. **Dynamic Context Retrieval Pipeline**

   - **Automated Retrieval Triggers**: Build a pipeline that tracks when undefined references or errors occur in generated code. When an undefined variable or function is detected, the pipeline:
     1. Searches the codebase for the relevant function, variable, or class based on its name or related metadata.
     2. Retrieves the most likely candidates and injects them into the model context for re-evaluation.
   - **Retrieval Queue with Re-evaluation**: If the initial context is insufficient, re-queue the prompt with the retrieved code. Repeat this process iteratively until all dependencies are resolved or a predefined retrieval limit is reached.

### 5. **Hierarchical Context Management with Priority Rules**

   - **Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Context Layers**: Divide the codebase into primary (immediate scope, recent interactions), secondary (dependencies), and tertiary (general library and utility functions) layers. Set rules for retrieval, prioritizing dependencies or closely related code in secondary layers.
   - **Prioritizing Recently Accessed or Relevant Code**: Use a caching mechanism that keeps the recently retrieved chunks available. This way, if the model references a specific function multiple times, it doesn’t need to keep retrieving it.

### Implementation Outline for a Context-Aware Code Retrieval System

Here’s a code outline to illustrate this setup, where the model can trigger context retrieval if it detects missing information:

```python
import openai
from transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Initialize components
tokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained("openai-gpt")
embed_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Mock codebase with metadata
codebase = {
    "validate_data": {"code": "def validate_data(data): ...", "dependencies": []},
    "process_request": {"code": "def process_request(data): ...", "dependencies": ["validate_data"]},
    # Add more code snippets with metadata
}

# Function to retrieve code by similarity search
def retrieve_code_by_name(name):
    if name in codebase:
        return codebase[name]["code"]
    else:
        return None

# Identify missing dependencies from generated code
def check_missing_dependencies(generated_code):
    missing_dependencies = []
    # This function should parse the generated code for undefined terms, variables, or functions
    # For simplicity, here it checks against a predefined list of known functions in codebase
    known_functions = codebase.keys()
    for line in generated_code.splitlines():
        for func in known_functions:
            if func in line and retrieve_code_by_name(func) is None:
                missing_dependencies.append(func)
    return missing_dependencies

# Retrieve context if missing dependencies are detected
def complete_code_with_dependencies(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    generated_code = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    
    # Check for missing dependencies
    missing_dependencies = check_missing_dependencies(generated_code)
    if missing_dependencies:
        dependency_code = "\n".join(retrieve_code_by_name(dep) for dep in missing_dependencies)
        prompt_with_dependencies = dependency_code + "\n" + prompt
        return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt_with_dependencies}]
        )
    return generated_code

# Example usage
prompt = "Refactor the process_request function to include logging."
completed_code = complete_code_with_dependencies(prompt)
print(completed_code)
```

### Advanced Extensions

1. **Embedding-based Cross-Reference Search**: Extend the retrieval system to do embedding-based cross-referencing, so it can retrieve not just exact names but similar code patterns or related terms.
2. **Keyword Extraction for Real-time Retrieval**: Use keyword extraction on the prompt or generated code to preemptively search for related terms.
3. **Error-driven Dependency Resolution**: Integrate a code linter or error-checker that triggers dependency retrieval automatically if syntax or runtime errors related to missing functions or variables are detected.

By implementing these steps, the model can achieve an awareness of what’s missing in its context and retrieve the required information on-demand, helping it generate more accurate, complete code in real-time. This setup also reduces manual oversight, making the process more seamless during development in large codebases.

## this is where the docs source code was added

To steer your auto-documentation script toward being a developer tool for managing a language model's context window, you can implement and integrate several core features that automate dynamic context management, enhance relevance, and allow for a flexible setup compatible with various model workflows.

Here's how you could approach this goal:

### 1. **Automated Context Management with Dependency Detection**

   - **Dependency Analysis Engine**: Develop a component that parses source code or documentation to build dependency trees for classes, functions, and modules. This can automatically detect related parts of a codebase, making it easier to retrieve context dynamically.
   - **Embedding-based Retrieval for Relevance**: Create an embedding-based retrieval mechanism to pull in context from similar parts of the codebase or documentation based on developer queries or code structure.
   - **Token Usage Monitoring**: Integrate a token counter that checks context length in real-time and performs dynamic summarization or context reduction based on token thresholds.

### 2. **Hierarchical Summarization with Prioritization**

   - **Layered Summarization**: Create summaries at various levels of granularity (e.g., function-level, module-level, project-level). The tool can decide which level of detail to include based on token availability and query specificity.
   - **Dynamic Summarization Triggering**: Summarize lower-priority context when the token limit is close. Implement a rule-based or ML-based system to determine the optimal level of summarization for each interaction.

### 3. **Contextual Awareness and Dependency Resolution**

   - **Automatic Dependency Retrieval**: If a developer’s query involves code that references other functions or classes, the tool should automatically pull in these dependencies based on a dependency map or embeddings. This will ensure the model has the full picture when generating responses.
   - **Metadata Annotation for Retrieval**: Tag code and documentation snippets with metadata (e.g., function name, purpose, dependencies) so that the system can pull in the most relevant context quickly based on developer needs.

### 4. **Adaptive Prompt Engineering**

   - **Context-driven Prompt Customization**: Adjust prompts based on the type of information required. For instance, if a developer is focused on debugging, the prompt can prioritize explanations and solutions. If focused on development, the prompt could prioritize functionality.
   - **User-Defined Context Rules**: Allow developers to define which parts of the code or documentation are more critical for specific types of interactions, enabling flexible, user-driven context management.

### 5. **Dynamic Code Summarization and Documentation Generation**

   - **On-the-fly Code Summarization**: Automate real-time summarization for long code snippets, allowing developers to focus on concise explanations. Use this in conjunction with dependency detection to produce summary-level documentation that evolves as the codebase grows.
   - **Documentation Hierarchies**: Build documentation hierarchies based on function, class, and module levels, allowing easy retrieval and streamlined summaries that adapt to the developer’s focus.

### Implementation Example

Once these features are integrated, the tool can be directed to automate context-based interactions. Would you like assistance in designing code or workflows based on any specific part of your script, or should I take a look at the uploaded file to provide more targeted guidance?

---

To fully implement each feature outlined in the action plan, here is a series of specific prompts that you can use as development tasks or checkpoints. Each prompt is designed to guide the development of a key feature, ensuring that your implementation of dependency tagging, context-aware code retrieval, and other advanced techniques proceeds systematically.

### **1. Dependency and Metadata Tagging**

**1.1. AST-based Dependency Parsing**
   - **Prompt**: *"Implement an AST-based parser that scans code chunks to identify function calls, imported modules, and class relationships. The parser should populate the `dependencies` attribute of each `ChunkMetadata` instance with a list of identifiers for these dependencies."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Test the AST parser on various code samples to ensure it correctly identifies both internal and external dependencies, including nested functions and imported modules."*

**1.2. Usage Tracking for Code Chunks**
   - **Prompt**: *"Extend the metadata system to include a `used_by` attribute that tracks code chunks referencing the current chunk. Implement a mechanism that updates this attribute when a chunk is referenced elsewhere in the codebase."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Create a test suite that verifies `used_by` tracking is accurate, even when the referenced code is nested within other functions or classes."*

**1.3. Enhanced Metadata Fields**
   - **Prompt**: *"Add fields to `ChunkMetadata` such as `purpose`, `last_modified`, and `importance`. Implement logic to assign and update these fields dynamically based on usage patterns and frequency of references in other code segments."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Develop a utility function that provides a summary report for a given code chunk, including all metadata fields and their current values."*

### **2. Context-Aware Code Retrieval System**

**2.1. Embedding-based Similarity Matching**

   - **Prompt**: *"Ensure that the retrieval system is optimized for speed by using efficient data structures like KD-trees or using GPU acceleration if available."*

**2.2. Priority-based Context Retrieval**
   - **Prompt**: *"Implement a prioritization system for code chunk retrieval based on metadata attributes such as `importance`, `chunk_type`, and `used_by` relationships. Ensure that the system retrieves the highest-priority chunks first, within token constraints."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Test the prioritization system with various developer queries to confirm that the most relevant chunks are consistently selected."*

**2.3. Adaptive Token Management**
   - **Prompt**: *"Build a token manager that tracks the number of tokens in the current context. Integrate the token manager with the code retrieval system to prune or summarize chunks dynamically when token limits are reached."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Write tests that simulate different token scenarios (e.g., close to limit, over limit) to verify that the token manager reduces context appropriately and that no critical information is lost."*

### **3. Hierarchical Summarization and Adaptive Context Management**

**3.1. Multi-level Summarization**
   - **Prompt**: *"Implement a multi-level summarization system that generates summaries for each code chunk at varying levels of detail (function-level, module-level, and project-level). Ensure that these summaries are stored alongside the original code chunks for quick retrieval."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Create a decision-making component that selects the appropriate summary level based on the developer query and the available token space."*

**3.2. Summarization on Demand**
   - **Prompt**: *"Develop a summarization pipeline that is triggered when a code chunk exceeds the token limit. Use a summarization model (e.g., GPT) to reduce the size of the chunk while preserving essential information."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Test the summarization pipeline by generating summaries for various code segments and comparing them to manually created summaries for accuracy."*

**3.3. Context Window Management**
   - **Prompt**: *"Implement a sliding window mechanism for managing context. The window should retain the most relevant and recent code or documentation based on developer interactions, and should automatically adjust when new context is added or removed."*

### **4. Enhanced Prompt Engineering and Error-Driven Retrieval**

**4.1. Error Checking and Missing Dependency Retrieval**
   - **Prompt**: *"Integrate an error-checking mechanism that parses generated code for undefined references. When an undefined reference is detected, trigger the retrieval system to locate the missing function or class and provide it in the next model call."*

**4.2. Dependency-based Prompt Adjustment**
   - **Prompt**: *"Create a prompt adjustment system that modifies the prompt structure based on detected dependencies. For instance, if a function depends on a class, ensure the prompt includes relevant details about the class context."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Verify that the prompt adjustment system produces optimal responses by testing it against prompts requiring different levels of context (e.g., isolated functions vs. interconnected classes)."*

**4.3. Feedback Loop for Iterative Retrieval**
   - **Prompt**: *"Build a feedback loop that monitors model responses for completeness. If the response is missing critical context, the loop should re-query the model with additional context, iterating until all dependencies are resolved."*
   - **Prompt**: *"Test the feedback loop by intentionally providing incomplete context and observing whether the system successfully retrieves the missing information in subsequent iterations."*

### **5. Modular and Extensible Design for Compatibility with Any Language Model**

**1.2. Usage Tracking for Code Chunks**
   - **Refined Prompt**: *"Extend `ChunkMetadata` to include a `used_by` attribute that tracks code chunks referencing the current chunk. Implement a function in `code_chunk.py` that updates this attribute whenever a chunk is referenced elsewhere in the codebase. Test this function using a controlled test suite of five Python files, ensuring it accurately identifies usage for functions referenced both within the same file and across different files."*

**1.3. Enhanced Metadata Fields**
   - **Refined Prompt**: *"Add `purpose`, `last_modified`, and `importance` fields to `ChunkMetadata`. The `purpose` should be automatically filled based on docstrings if available, `last_modified` should be retrieved using file metadata, and `importance` should be calculated based on the frequency of references in the codebase. Write unit tests to verify each field's accuracy and completeness for at least five sample code chunks."*

When detected, the system should automatically query the codebase to retrieve the missing code chunk and reprocess the prompt. Test the module using five scenarios where missing dependencies are intentionally introduced, ensuring that it successfully retrieves and integrates each missing function."*

**4.2. Dependency-based Prompt Adjustment**
   - **Refined Prompt**: *"Implement a prompt adjustment system that dynamically modifies prompts based on detected dependencies using the `ChunkMetadata` structure. The system should prioritize including related classes and modules when functions have unresolved dependencies. Verify this by running tests where the model is queried with partial function definitions and confirming that the adjusted prompt consistently includes the correct dependent context."*

**4.3. Feedback Loop for Iterative Retrieval**
   - **Refined Prompt**: *"Create a feedback loop mechanism that monitors responses from the model. If the response contains placeholders for missing context (e.g., 'function X not found'), the system should automatically retrieve the relevant code and re-query the model with the updated context. Test this loop using a series of incomplete prompts to ensure it successfully resolves each case in under three iterations."*

### **5. Modular and Extensible Design for Compatibility with Any Language Model**

**5.2. Plugin System for Extensibility**
   - **Refined Prompt**: *"Implement a plugin system that supports hot-swappable modules for specific programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript). The plugins should be configured via a JSON file, enabling dynamic loading without restarting the main application. Test this system by creating and swapping at least two plugins, ensuring they operate seamlessly without codebase changes."*

**5.3. Configuration and User-defined Context Rules**
   - **Refined Prompt**: *"Build a configuration module that allows developers to define rules for context retention and prioritization using YAML files. The system should be capable of reloading these rules dynamically at runtime. Test the configuration system by defining three different rule sets (e.g., prioritize classes, minimize utility functions, and prioritize recent code) and ensuring each is applied correctly during context management."*

Here's a more detailed approach to implementing granular locking with semaphores in the `_process_single_file` function. This will help ensure that file I/O and API calls are handled concurrently and safely.

---

### **Implementation Steps for Granular Locking in `_process_single_file`**

1. **Identify Critical Sections**:
   - Begin by reviewing `_process_single_file` to identify the critical sections where file I/O and API calls occur.
   - Mark these sections to ensure that only specific operations (like file I/O and API calls) are locked, allowing other processing tasks to continue concurrently.

2. **Implement Semaphores**:
   - Introduce two separate semaphores:
     - **File I/O Semaphore**: Controls access to file read/write operations.
     - **API Call Semaphore**: Manages access to API calls, particularly if the API has a rate limit or if tasks require controlled access to reduce load.

3. **Integrate Semaphores in Critical Sections**:
   - Wrap the file I/O operations in an `async with file_io_semaphore` block.
   - Similarly, wrap API calls in `async with api_call_semaphore`.
   - This ensures that each semaphore only locks the associated operations, maximizing parallelism for non-critical operations.

4. **Testing for Parallel Processing**:
   - Create a test script to run `_process_single_file` in parallel with multiple files.
   - Ensure that file I/O and API calls do not block each other unnecessarily, confirming that granular locking is effective.
   - Add logging or print statements in the critical sections to verify that file and API operations are executed concurrently.

---

### **Prompt 1: Detailed Prompt**

*“Implement granular locking in `_process_single_file` by adding semaphores for file I/O and API calls. Use a `file_io_semaphore` to wrap all file read/write operations and an `api_call_semaphore` to control API calls. Ensure that each semaphore applies only to critical sections and that non-critical tasks continue executing in parallel. Test the modified function by running multiple files in parallel, confirming through logs or output that file I/O and API calls proceed concurrently without conflicts or blocking. Verify that parallel execution improves performance, and adjust semaphore limits based on observed load.”*

Your prompts are thoughtfully designed to implement several advanced strategies and techniques for enhancing the embedding-based similarity matching system in `DocuScribe`. Below, I’ll break down each prompt, explaining how it aligns with the strategies discussed earlier and provide additional insights to ensure effective implementation.

---

### ### Prompt 1: Contextual Embeddings and Dependency-Aware Retrieval

**Prompt:**
> "Develop a system that integrates contextual embeddings by incorporating surrounding code context, such as function definitions, class structures, and module dependencies. Implement a graph-based approach to model dependencies and interconnections between code chunks. Ensure the retrieval system leverages this contextual and dependency information to enhance the relevance of retrieved results, especially in large and interconnected codebases."

**Implementation Strategies:**

1. **Contextual Embeddings:**
   - **Incorporating Surrounding Code Context:** By including function definitions, class structures, and module dependencies, the embeddings can capture more comprehensive semantic information. This ensures that the embeddings represent not just isolated code snippets but also their relationships and roles within the larger codebase.
   
2. **Graph-Based Approach:**
   - **Modeling Dependencies and Interconnections:** Using a graph-based model (e.g., Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), Dependency Graphs) allows the system to understand and represent the structural and functional relationships between different code chunks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be employed to process these graphs and generate embeddings that encapsulate both content and context.

3. **Enhanced Retrieval Relevance:**
   - **Leveraging Contextual Information:** By integrating context and dependencies into the embeddings, the retrieval system can prioritize code chunks that are not only semantically similar but also contextually relevant, which is crucial in large and interconnected codebases where context dictates functionality and relevance.

**Additional Insights:**

- **Tools and Libraries:**
  - Consider using libraries like [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for graph modeling and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) or [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) for implementing graph neural networks.

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Graph-based models can be computationally intensive. Optimize by limiting the scope of context (e.g., within the same module or file) or by using efficient graph sampling techniques.

- **Maintenance:**
  - Ensure that the graph representation is dynamically updated as the codebase evolves to maintain accurate context and dependency information.

### ### Prompt 2: Combining Embeddings with Metadata

**Prompt:**
> "Enhance the similarity matching process by integrating metadata such as function names, variable names, and code metrics into the embedding calculations. Implement a weighting mechanism that combines embeddings with these metadata features to provide more contextual relevance. Ensure that the system can dynamically adjust weights based on the importance of different metadata attributes."

**Implementation Strategies:**

1. **Integration of Metadata:**
   - **Function Names, Variable Names, Code Metrics:** These metadata elements provide additional semantic and structural information that pure embeddings might miss. For example, function names can indicate the purpose of a code chunk, while variable names can hint at its functionality.

2. **Weighting Mechanism:**
   - **Combining Embeddings with Metadata Features:** Develop a method to fuse embeddings with metadata. This could involve concatenation, weighted summation, or more sophisticated fusion techniques like attention mechanisms.
   - **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement a system where the importance of each metadata attribute can be adjusted based on factors such as user feedback, usage patterns, or specific retrieval tasks. This ensures flexibility and adaptability in the similarity matching process.

**Additional Insights:**

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Normalize metadata features to ensure they are on comparable scales before integration.
  - Use techniques like TF-IDF for textual metadata (e.g., function and variable names) to capture their importance.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - Consider multi-modal models that can handle both vector embeddings and structured metadata inputs.
  - Alternatively, use ensemble methods where separate models process embeddings and metadata, and their outputs are combined.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Regularly assess the impact of metadata integration on retrieval performance using metrics like precision, recall, and user satisfaction.

### ### Prompt 3: Multi-Layer Embeddings for Richer Representation

**Prompt:**
> "Utilize embeddings from different layers of the model to capture various levels of abstraction, such as syntactic and semantic information. Develop a method to combine these multi-layer embeddings into a comprehensive representation of code chunks. Test the system to ensure it accurately captures both surface-level syntax and deeper semantic meaning, improving retrieval accuracy."

**Implementation Strategies:**

1. **Multi-Layer Embeddings:**
   - **Different Levels of Abstraction:** Lower layers of transformer-based models often capture syntactic information, while higher layers capture more semantic and contextual information. By extracting embeddings from multiple layers, you can create a more nuanced representation of code.

2. **Combining Embeddings:**
   - **Comprehensive Representation:** Develop a strategy to fuse embeddings from different layers. This could involve concatenation, weighted averaging, or using attention mechanisms to prioritize certain layers based on their relevance.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - **Accuracy Assessment:** Implement evaluation protocols to ensure that the combined embeddings effectively capture both syntax and semantics. This could involve benchmark tasks, user studies, or specific code retrieval scenarios.

**Additional Insights:**

- **Dimensionality Management:**
  - Combining embeddings from multiple layers can increase the dimensionality. Use dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or autoencoders to manage this.

- **Layer Selection:**
  - Experiment with selecting specific layers that offer the best balance between syntactic and semantic information rather than using all layers.

- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - Fine-tune the model with tasks that encourage the preservation and utilization of multi-layer information to enhance the quality of the combined embeddings.

### ### Prompt 4: Dynamic Indexing for Efficient Updates

**Prompt:**
> "Implement a dynamic indexing strategy that allows for incremental updates as code changes, avoiding the need for frequent full index rebuilds. Use techniques like delta indexing to efficiently manage changes and maintain up-to-date retrieval capabilities. Ensure the system can handle high volumes of updates without degrading performance."

**Implementation Strategies:**

1. **Dynamic Indexing:**
   - **Incremental Updates:** Design the indexing system to allow for adding, removing, or updating individual code chunks without needing to rebuild the entire index. This is crucial for large and frequently changing codebases.

2. **Delta Indexing:**
   - **Efficient Change Management:** Implement delta indexing where only the changes (deltas) since the last index update are processed and integrated into the existing index. This minimizes computational overhead and speeds up the update process.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - **High Volume Handling:** Ensure that the indexing system can manage a high frequency of updates without significant performance degradation. This may involve optimizing data structures, parallel processing, or leveraging efficient indexing libraries.

**Additional Insights:**

- **Indexing Libraries:**
  - Utilize libraries like [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) which support dynamic indexing and can handle incremental updates efficiently.

- **Concurrency Control:**
  - Implement mechanisms to handle concurrent updates and queries to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Set up monitoring to track indexing performance and detect any bottlenecks or failures during the update process.

- **Scalability:**
  - For extremely large codebases, consider sharding the index or using distributed indexing solutions to maintain performance as the dataset grows.
