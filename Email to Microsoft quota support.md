Hi Vinay,

Thank you for your prompt response and assistance with my quota increase request.

The business justification for requesting multiple SKUs in the same region is to ensure that we have flexibility in selecting the optimal SKU for various workloads, particularly for high-performance computing (HPC) tasks, AI/ML workloads, and GPU-intensive simulations. We are currently in the process of scaling up our AI infrastructure, and the varying SKUs allow us to tailor our resources based on the specific needs of different projects.

Here’s a breakdown of our usage plan for each SKU:

- **NVads A10 v5 Series**: Primarily for AI inference tasks that require moderate GPU power. We anticipate this SKU to be heavily utilized for real-time AI applications.
  
- **NCsv3 Series**: Used for training complex AI models that require large-scale parallel processing capabilities.
  
- **NCasT4v3 Series**: Suitable for running multiple concurrent AI/ML workloads that are less GPU-intensive. We expect high demand for this SKU as it provides a good balance between cost and performance.

- **NCads H100 v5 Series**: Critical for cutting-edge AI research and development that demands the highest performance available in the region.

- **NC A100 v4 Series**: This will be used for tasks that require massive computational power, such as deep learning model training at scale.

Given the variety of workloads and the need for redundancy to ensure high availability, having access to these SKUs within the same region is crucial for our operations. Our ramp plan involves gradually increasing usage over the next 3 to 6 months as we onboard more projects and transition existing workloads to these new resources.

Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,

Hi Vinay,

Thank you for your prompt response and assistance with my quota increase request.

The business justification for requesting multiple SKUs in the same region is primarily driven by our need for flexibility in selecting the optimal SKU for diverse workloads, especially in high-performance computing (HPC), AI/ML workloads, and GPU-intensive simulations. As we scale up our AI infrastructure, having access to various SKUs allows us to customize resources based on the distinct requirements of each project.

Here’s an outline of our planned usage for each SKU:

- **NVads A10 v5 Series**: Targeted at AI inference tasks needing moderate GPU power; crucial for real-time AI applications expected to see heavy use.
  
- **NCsv3 Series**: Designated for training intricate AI models requiring extensive parallel processing capabilities.
  
- **NCasT4v3 Series**: Optimal for running multiple concurrent AI/ML workloads that are less GPU-intensive; anticipated high demand due to its cost-performance balance.

- **NCads H100 v5 Series**: Essential for advanced AI research demanding top-tier performance in the region.

- **NC A100 v4 Series**: Utilized for tasks necessitating significant computational power like deep learning model training at scale.

To ensure high availability and redundancy across these workloads, access to these SKUs within the same region is vital. Our ramp plan involves gradually increasing usage over the next 3 to 6 months as we onboard more projects and transition existing workloads onto these new resources.

Please let me know if there are any further details required from my end or if there's anything else I can assist with.
