### 1. Cohere Python Library
**Repository:** [cohere-ai/cohere-python](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python)

#### Overview
The Cohere Python library provides a convenient way to access Cohere's API for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, classification, and more. It abstracts the complexities of HTTP requests, allowing developers to focus on building applications.

#### Installation
To install the Cohere Python library, use pip:
```bash
pip install cohere
```

#### Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of generating text using the Cohere API:
```python
import cohere

# Initialize the client with your API key
co = cohere.Client('your-api-key')

# Generate text with a specified prompt
response = co.generate(
    model='large',
    prompt='Once upon a time in a land far, far away...',
    max_tokens=50
)

# Output the generated text
print(response.generations[0].text)
```

#### Common Issues and Troubleshooting
- **Invalid API Key:** Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
- **Network Errors:** Verify your internet connection and ensure no firewall is blocking API requests.

   ```python
   # Step 1: Classify content
   classification = co.classify(
       inputs=["This content is offensive"],
       examples=[
           {"text": "This is inappropriate", "label": "flagged"},
           {"text": "This is fine", "label": "safe"}
       ]
   )
   if classification.classifications[0].prediction == "flagged":
       # Step 2: Generate a report
       report = co.generate(
           model='medium',
           prompt='Generate a report for flagged content.',
           max_tokens=50
       )
       print(report.generations[0].text)
   ```

2. **Automated Customer Support:**
   - **Step 1:** Use the Chat API to interact with users.
   - **Step 2:** Classify the user's issue and provide solutions.
   ```python
   # Step 1: Chat with user
   chat_response = co.chat(
       model='chat',
       messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need help with my order.'}]
   )
   user_message = chat_response.messages[-1]['content']

   # Step 2: Classify issue
   issue_classification = co.classify(
       inputs=[user_message],
       examples=[
           {"text": "I can't track my order", "label": "tracking"},
           {"text": "I want to return an item", "label": "returns"}
       ]
   )
   print(issue_classification.classifications[0].prediction)
   ```
