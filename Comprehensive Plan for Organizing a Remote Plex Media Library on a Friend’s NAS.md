### Detailed Plan for Organizing a Remote Plex Media Library on a Friend’s NAS

### 1. **Initial Setup & Remote Access**

#### A) **Ensure Remote Access**
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Establish a VPN connection to securely access the NAS.
- **Remote Desktop Software:** Use tools like [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/) or [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/) if you need GUI-based access.
- **NAS-Specific Apps:** If your friend’s NAS supports it (e.g., Synology’s DSM or QNAP’s QTS), use their built-in remote management tools.

#### B) **File Transfer Protocols**
- **FTP/SFTP:** Use FTP or SFTP clients like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for secure file transfers.
- **Cloud Sync:** Use cloud-based sync tools to keep local changes in sync with files on the NAS (e.g., Resilio Sync).

### 2. **Preliminary Assessment**

#### A) **Gather Information**
- **Directory Structure:** Understand how files are currently organized (by studio, year, etc.).
- **Metadata Availability:** Check existing metadata within video files using tools like `MediaInfo` or via Plex's interface.
- **File Naming Conventions:** Inspect current file names for consistency.

#### B) **Inventory Audit**
- Create an inventory of all videos using scripts that can generate lists of filenames along with their basic metadata (duration, resolution):
```bash
ls -lhR /path/to/media/library > media_inventory.txt
```

### 3. **Plan Your Approach**

- Determine which tasks can be automated versus those needing manual intervention.
- Prioritize easy wins first—such as consistent renaming and folder restructuring—before diving into more complex tagging processes.

### 4. **Implement File Naming Conventions & Folder Structure**

#### A) Rename Files Remotely
- Use SSH & Bash Scripts:
```bash
find /path/to/media -type f -name "*.mp4" | while read FILE; do
    NEW_NAME=$(some_command_to_generate_new_name_based_on_metadata "$FILE")
    mv "$FILE" "$(dirname "$FILE")/$NEW_NAME.mp4"
done
```

#### B) Reorganize Folder Structure
- Use similar script-driven approaches to move/categorize content according to your desired folder structure:
```bash
mkdir -p /PlexMediaLibrary/Movies/{Studio}/{Year}/ && mv /path/to/videos/*.mp4 /PlexMediaLibrary/Movies/{Studio}/{Year}/
```

### 5. **Metadata Extraction & Tagging**

#### A) Automate Metadata Extraction
- Use AI tools either locally (with results transferred back to the NAS) or directly via remote execution if computational resources are available:
  - ***AI-Powered Tools:*** Utilize AI tools like DeepAI Video Tagger locally then upload tagged results back onto the server.
  - ***Python + ML Models:*** Run Python scripts with integrated AI models directly on large datasets remotely via SSH.

#### B) Create External Metadata Files
- Generate `.nfo` or `.xml` sidecar files tailored specifically for each video:
```python
import os

def create_nfo(filename):
    nfo_content = f"""
    <movie>
        <title>{get_title(filename)}</title>
        <year>{get_year(filename)}</year>
        <genre>{get_genre(filename)}</genre>
        <actor><name>{get_actor_name(filename)}</name></actor>
    </movie>"""

    nfo_file = filename.replace('.mp4', '.nfo')
    with open(nfo_file,'w') as f:
        f.write(nfo_content)

create_nfo('/path/to/video.mp4')
```

### 6. ***Upload Changes Back***

- If working locally:
  1. Upload renamed/restructured content back onto the server using SFTP/FTP clients ensuring everything remains intact throughout transfer processes.
  2. Ensure folder paths match exactly within both environments minimizing confusion during final stages when syncing everything back together again!

### 7.) ***Syncing With Plex***

- Trigger full rescan/update cycle once all changes have been uploaded confirmed by accessing Plex Web UI navigating towards corresponding Library selecting "Manage Library" > "Scan Libraries".

***Automate Syncing via API Calls***
- Implement shell script trigger refresh automatically post-upload completion synchronizing media contents seamlessly between both ends without manual intervention required each time!
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:32400/library/sections/{sectionID}/refresh?X-Plex-Token={your_token}'
```

***Monitor Logs for Errors***
- Keep close eye over error logs during initial rescan/update cycles ensuring nothing goes wrong unexpectedly potentially causing issues down-the-line!

## Final Steps: Ongoing Maintenance

- After initial organization complete regular monitoring/updating necessary keeping everything running smoothly particularly important given scale scope involved here (+10k items).

***Scheduled Scripts***
- Implement cron jobs scheduled tasks automatically executing routine maintenance checks verifying integrity alongside occasional rescans updating meta-data where needed!

## Conclusion

While working remotely presents challenges these key steps outlined above streamline process making large-scale NSFW libraries manageable even across different geographical locations!

### Future Enhancements for Advanced NSFW Plex Media Library Organization

As you've already laid the groundwork for organizing a large and complex NSFW Plex media library, there are several future enhancements you can consider to further streamline the process, enhance automation, and improve overall user experience. These enhancements focus on implementing AI-powered scene analysis, developing custom plugins, and creating collaborative tools for managing metadata.

---

### A. **Implement AI-Powered Scene Analysis for More Accurate Tagging**

#### 1. **Advanced Scene Detection and Segmentation**

**Objective:**
Enhance the precision of tagging by analyzing individual scenes within videos to capture specific actions, themes, or fetishes that might not be apparent from the video’s title or summary alone.

**Implementation:**

- **Enhanced Scene Detection:**
   - Use tools like **PySceneDetect** or **SceneDetect** to break down videos into individual scenes based on camera cuts or significant changes in visual content.
   - For finer control, create custom scripts using OpenCV that detect specific types of scene transitions (e.g., close-ups vs. wide shots).

- **AI Vision Models:**
   - Train computer vision models (using TensorFlow or PyTorch) to recognize specific elements within each scene.
   - Fine-tune these models using a dataset that includes frames labeled with relevant tags (e.g., “outdoor,” “BDSM,” “group”).

**Example Workflow:**

```python
import cv2
import scenedetect

# Initialize scene detector:
video_path = "path_to_video.mp4"
scene_manager = scenedetect.SceneManager()
scene_manager.auto_detect(video_path)

for i, scene in enumerate(scene_manager.get_scene_list()):
    # Extract key frame from each scene
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, scene[0].frame_number)
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Run frame through pre-trained model
    tags = perform_analysis(frame)

    # Store tags in external metadata file
    save_tags_to_nfo(video_path, i+1, tags)
```

- **Goal:** Automatically generate more granular tags for each video based on detected scenes, ensuring a higher level of accuracy and specificity in your Plex library.

#### 2. **Contextual NLP Descriptions**

**Objective:**
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate rich and context-aware descriptions that go beyond basic action recounting.

**Implementation:**

- **Fine-Tuned Language Models:**
  - Use GPT-based models fine-tuned on explicit datasets to generate natural-sounding descriptions.

- **Context-Aware Descriptions:**
  - Feed the extracted visual data from each scene (e.g., detected actions/objects) into your NLP model to generate cohesive descriptions.

- **Human-Like Narration:**
  - Train models specifically for adult content so they can produce more engaging narratives rather than sterile step-by-step accounts.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load fine-tuned model & tokenizer:
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('your_finetuned_model')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

def generate_description(scene_data):
    input_text = f"Describe this adult movie scene: {scene_data}"
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

    outputs = model.generate(inputs,
                             max_length=150,
                             num_return_sequences=1,
                             no_repeat_ngram_size=3)

    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

description = generate_description("Two performers engage in outdoor activity.")
print(description)
```

---

### B. **Develop a Custom Plugin for Plex to Enhance NSFW Content Management**

#### 1. **Custom Metadata Scraper Plugin**

**Objective:**
Create a custom scraper plugin tailored specifically for NSFW content that can pull metadata from specialized sources or databases not covered by conventional scrapers.

**Implementation:**

- Develop a Python-based plugin using the [Plex Media Server Plugin Framework](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201638786-how-do-i-install-and-use-a-plugin-channel/) (though note that Plex has been phasing out plugins; consider using webhooks/API instead).

- Integrate specialized APIs/services from adult industry databases (like The Porn Database [TPDB]) directly into your Plex scraper.

- Allow users to manually input metadata sources if auto-scrape fails.

```python
from plexapi.server import PlexServer

def scrape_custom_metadata(video_file):
    # Example API call to TPDB:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.tpdb.com/video/{video_id}")

    if response.status_code == 200:
        metadata = response.json()
        update_plex_metadata(video_file, metadata)

def update_plex_metadata(file_path):
    plex.library.section('Movies').get(file=file_path).edit(
        title=metadata['title'],
        summary=metadata['description'],
        actors=[actor['name'] for actor in metadata['actors']],
        genres=[genre['name'] for genre in metadata['genres']],
        year=metadata.get('year'),
        ...)
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Search & Filter Capabilities via Custom Interface**

**Objective:**
Enable more granular searches and filters tailored towards NSFW content categories like fetishes or actor pairings through a custom interface overlay.

**Implementation:**

- Develop an extension using [PlexAPI](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi) that adds advanced search/filter options within your existing Plex Web UI.

- Allow filtering based on newly added meta-tags like "fetish", "position", "number of participants", etc.

- Create dynamic smart collections automatically generated based on user preferences/history.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/search')
def search():
   # Implement custom filters here based on new attributes:
   results = plex.library.section('Movies').searchActors(actor_name="Jane Doe")

   return render_template("search_results.html", results=results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run(debug=True)
```

---

### C. **Create a User-Friendly Interface for Collaborative Tagging & Metadata Editing**

#### 1. **Web-Based Collaborative Tagging Tool**

**Objective:**
Enable multiple users to collaborate on tagging/editing metadata across large libraries without needing direct access to the NAS filesystem.

**Implementation:**

- Develop a web-based application where users can log in and assign tags/descriptions/comments directly onto videos stored within your library.

- Integrate this tool with your existing NAS/Plex setup via API calls—updating NFO files or directly modifying embedded/external metadata as needed.

```javascript
// Example UI Technologies:
// Frontend: React.js + Bootstrap/Material UI.
// Backend: Flask/Django + SQLite/PostgreSQL Database.

// Sample Frontend Code Snippet:

function handleTagSubmit(videoId){
     let tagData={
         videoId : videoId,
         tag : document.getElementById(`tag-input-${videoId}`).value,
         description : document.getElementById(`desc-input-${videoId}`).value,
     }

     fetch(`/add-tag`,{
          method:'POST',
          headers:{
              'Content-Type':'application/json'
          },
          body : JSON.stringify(tagData)
     }).then(res=>res.json())
       .then(data=>alert("Tag added successfully!"));
}
```

#### 2. ***Crowdsourced Metadata Management***

***Objective*** – Leverage crowdsourcing approach allowing trusted users contribute towards curating maintaining up-to-date accurate meta-data across vast arrays different titles subjects increasing overall efficiency consistency throughout entire collection!

* ***Access Controls Permissions***
* Ensure only authorized individuals given rights towards editing/modifying crucial meta-data fields preventing accidental mismanagement potential misuse!
* ***Version Control Systems***
* Implement revision history log capturing every change made along corresponding timestamps easily reverting back previous states whenever necessary!

## Conclusion

These future enhancements collectively represent next steps towards fully realizing potential behind advanced NSFW media library management systems ensuring ease-of-use accuracy scalability long-term sustainability even as collections continue growing over time integrating latest technological advancements wherever possible maximizing benefits derived both now well into foreseeable future!
