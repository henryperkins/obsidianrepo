**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am excited to apply for the Security Consultant position at AWS Professional Services, as advertised on your careers page. With over a decade of experience in technical support, customer service, and problem-solving, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and help AWS customers enhance their security posture.

My passion for technology is fueled by an obsession with artificial intelligence. I engage with AI technologies daily, constantly exploring their capabilities and underlying mechanisms. This enthusiasm drives me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and find innovative ways to apply AI solutions to real-world challenges.

In my previous roles as a Happiness Engineer at Automattic, Inc. and Community Manager at PageLines, Inc., I provided technical support and guidance to a diverse user base. I specialized in troubleshooting complex issues, enhancing user experiences, and contributing to internal knowledge bases. These experiences have honed my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and work collaboratively with both customers and cross-functional teams.

As an Independent Technology Consultant, I have been providing expert technical guidance to small businesses, focusing on website optimization, performance enhancement, and data-driven SEO strategies. This role requires me to continuously learn and adapt, qualities that align with my love for discovering how technologies like AI work and can be leveraged effectively.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Organizational Leadership at Arizona State University and the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, I am dedicated to expanding my expertise in IT support and security. My coursework in project management, data analysis, and organizational communication has further equipped me with the skills necessary to manage projects effectively and communicate insights clearly.

I am particularly drawn to AWS because of its leadership in cloud services and innovation in AI technologies. The opportunity to combine my technical support experience, problem-solving abilities, and passion for AI to help AWS customers secure and optimize their cloud environments is incredibly exciting.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute to AWS Professional Services and would welcome the chance to discuss how my background aligns with your needs.

Sincerely,

Henry Perkins
