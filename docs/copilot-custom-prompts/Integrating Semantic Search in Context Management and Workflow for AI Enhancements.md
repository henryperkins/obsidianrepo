# Integrating Semantic Search in Context Management and Workflow for AI Enhancements

Certainly! Let's merge the ideas from the previous prompts with the detailed integration steps and example code snippets to create a comprehensive guide for implementing semantic search in your project.

## **Prompt Template for Feature Implementation**

### **5. Semantic Search Integration**

#### **5.1. Implementing Semantic Search in Context Manager**

##### **Refined Prompt:**

> **Context:**  
> The `ContextManager` class in the `context_manager.py` module currently manages code segments based on access frequency and recency. The project uses a standardized file structure where core modules reside in the `core/` directory. The system is designed to optimize context windows for AI interactions by dynamically selecting relevant code segments. The project already includes a dependency on the `sentence-transformers` library for generating embeddings.

> **Task:**  
> Extend the `ContextManager` class to incorporate semantic search capabilities. This involves generating embeddings for each code segment using a pre-trained model from the `sentence-transformers` library and storing these embeddings for efficient retrieval. Implement a method to retrieve contextually relevant code segments based on semantic similarity to a given query or task description.

> **Restrictions:**  
> - **File Structure:** All modifications must be made within the `context_manager.py` file. Do not create new modules or alter the existing directory structure.  
> - **Coding Standards:** Follow the existing coding conventions, including naming conventions and documentation standards.  
> - **Performance:** Ensure that the embedding generation and search processes are optimized for performance, especially in large codebases.  
> - **Security:** Ensure that all inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.  
> - **Dependencies:** Use only the existing `sentence-transformers` library for embedding generation. Avoid introducing new dependencies.  
> - **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that the new semantic search functionality does not disrupt existing context management operations.  
> - **Other Restrictions:** The semantic search should support retrieving the top-k most relevant segments based on a similarity threshold.

### **5.2. Integrating Semantic Context in Main Workflow**

#### **Refined Prompt:**

> **Context:**  
> The main workflow for AI interactions is managed within the `main.py` and `workflow.py` modules. These modules handle the orchestration of tasks, including context retrieval and AI model interactions. The project aims to enhance AI performance by providing contextually relevant information dynamically.

> **Task:**  
> Modify the workflow in `workflow.py` to utilize the semantic search capabilities of the `ContextManager`. This involves generating an embedding for the AI's current task description and using it to retrieve the most relevant code segments. Integrate these segments into the AI's input prompt to improve task understanding and response accuracy.

> **Restrictions:**  
> - **File Structure:** All modifications must be made within the `workflow.py` file. Do not create new modules or alter the existing directory structure.  
> - **Coding Standards:** Adhere to the project's existing coding conventions, including naming conventions and documentation standards.  
> - **Performance:** Ensure that the integration does not introduce significant latency in AI interactions, optimizing for speed and efficiency.  
> - **Security:** Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.  
> - **Dependencies:** Use only existing project dependencies. Avoid introducing new external libraries.  
> - **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that the integration does not disrupt existing workflow functionalities.  
> - **Other Restrictions:** The integration should support dynamic context retrieval based on varying task descriptions.

### **Example Code Snippets**

#### Extending the ContextManager

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class SemanticContextManager(ContextManager):
    def __init__(self, model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2', *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
        self.embeddings = {}

    def add_or_update_segment(self, segment_id: str, code_segment: str):
        super().add_or_update_segment(segment_id, code_segment)
        # Generate and store embedding
        embedding = self.model.encode(code_segment)
        self.embeddings[segment_id] = embedding

    def get_semantic_context(self, query: str, top_k: int = 5):
        query_embedding = self.model.encode(query)
        scores = []

        for segment_id, embedding in self.embeddings.items():
            similarity = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], [embedding])[0][0]
            scores.append((similarity, segment_id))

        # Sort by similarity score
        scores.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
        # Retrieve top-k relevant segments
        relevant_segments = [self.code_segments[seg_id][0] for _, seg_id in scores[:top_k]]

        return relevant_segments
```

#### Modifying the Workflow

```python
async def interact_with_ai(task_description: str, context_manager: SemanticContextManager, ai_model):
    # Retrieve semantic context
    context_segments = context_manager.get_semantic_context(task_description)
    context_str = "\n".join(context_segments)

    # Prepare the prompt for the AI model
    prompt = f"Task: {task_description}\n\nContext:\n{context_str}\n\n"

    # Interact with the AI model
    response = await ai_model.generate_response(prompt)
    return response

# Example usage
context_manager = SemanticContextManager()
# Assume segments are added to the context manager
response = await interact_with_ai("optimize context management", context_manager, ai_model)
print(response)
```

### Conclusion

By integrating these steps and code snippets into your project, you can enable the AI model to retrieve context using semantic search. This enhancement allows the AI to access the most relevant information dynamically, improving its ability to perform tasks accurately and efficiently.
