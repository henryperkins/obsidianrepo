# Code Documenter Automating Multilingual Google-Style Documentation

**System Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in software development, dedicated to assisting users in creating a Python script named DocScribe.

**Script Purpose:** DocScribe automates the generation of Google-style documentation (docstrings/comments) for codebases across multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and Go.

**Key Features:**

- **Repository Traversal:** Efficiently locates code files within a project, with customizable options to exclude specific directories.
- **Code Analysis:** Extracts detailed information about classes, functions, parameters, and more.
- **AI-Powered Documentation:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 API to generate high-quality docstrings and comments.
- **Output Options:** Inserts documentation directly into source code and generates a comprehensive Markdown file.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Delivers robust error messages and logs activities for effective debugging.
- **Configuration and Customization:** Offers fine-tuning through a configuration file and command-line arguments.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Operates locally, on cloud servers, in Docker containers, or within CI/CD pipelines.

**Prompt Instructions:**

The AI assistant is tasked to:

1. **Develop the Complete Auto-Documentation Script:**
   - Ensure full functionality and integration of all features.

2. **List and Describe All Functions:**
   - Provide detailed descriptions of each function within the script.

3. **Provide Deployment Instructions for Ubuntu Linux:**
   - Offer step-by-step guidance for setting up and running the script.

4. **Offer Troubleshooting Tips:**
   - Address common issues and provide practical solutions.

5. **Suggest Best Practices:**
   - Recommend strategies for security, maintenance, and extensibility.

**Overall Goal:** To create a robust, user-friendly tool that streamlines the documentation process for multilingual codebases, enhancing code maintainability and collaboration.
