**Task: Create Comprehensive Documentation for Video-Text-to-Text Inference**



[![](./Video%20Processing%20Toolkit/Images/2024-09-07_google-photo_182732.jpg)](https://photos.google.com/lr/photo/AAUpajWdWVhC-nPptMcSuekzoJEl_hZlp5jKvVKH2XJ5vNNbvB3JbIWENGUFaLPAuoJnIaMkzGszJzF5MlNsyIc0xlCmSrXbyQ) 


Key Requirements:

- The documentation template, as shown in the provided screenshot, needs to be strictly adhered to.
- Emphasize: The task template needs complete inputs, outputs, and model details, following the structure from the middle diagram in the provided image.
- Contributions should directly address what the template is requesting (Input schema, Output schema, Model).
- Take inspiration from the [image-text-to-text](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/tasks/image_text_to_text#image-text-to-text) documentation for matching general flow of it to maintain consistency in readability with our own documentation efforts. Notice the example code to create the proper environments, practice inference with image input (video in our case)
- remember to link key terms and relevant acronyms (models datasets technologies) preferring to use huggingface.co documentation if relevant before outside sources. 

* Expand on the environment setup, inference methods, and examples should focus mostly on technologies associated with huggingface’s platform when possible

* Not necessary to literally say huggingface every other sentence - overkill on that please fix, also ensure to include example JSON input to infer with. Link to more actual functions and libraries whose documentation is available on huggingface’s internal network, Keep documentation of setup steps that will already be explained on other more dedicated pages and tutorials to a minimum, starting it off and then quickly linking to documentation for more information if needed. Try to keep code block examples in line with why the visitor is even reading this page, and  to video-text-to-text model technical specs and info
* Provide 2 additional video-text-to-text inference example code blocks with explanation
* Provide JSON examples where the autoprocessor will be used to process video in the input, talk about the memory it requires, and best practices
