Greetings! I am Henry Perkins from Lisle, Illinois. My professional trajectory has navigated through varied roles in customer service management, community engagement, and web development, each bound by the common thread of harnessing technology to enrich user experiences and cultivate community growth.

My initial professional engagement was as a Community Manager at PageLines, Inc., where I directed a vibrant community of 50 software developers, curated an App Store for plugins, extensions, and themes, and orchestrated engaging events. This tenure fostered a blend of technological innovation with community building, providing a conducive platform for developers and affiliates to thrive.oo

Transitioning to Automattic as a Happiness Engineer, I rendered technical and billing support across numerous platforms, ensuring a seamless customer journey. This role honed my ability to meld technical facets with user-friendly interfaces, establishing a solid foundation for my subsequent endeavors.

Venturing into the food and beverage sector, I began as a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks and later ascended to the role of Starbucks Manager under Sodexo's banner. These roles entailed ensuring premier customer satisfaction, mentoring a dynamic team of baristas, and managing a weekly sales volume of $30k. My managerial acumen was sharpened alongside a profound understanding of sales and human resources management.

As I continue on my professional voyage, I am keen on exploring opportunities that resonate with my skills and interests in technology, web design, and development. Concurrently, I am open to roles that leverage my managerial and community engagement expertise to propel business growth and customer satisfaction.

How might I assist you? My diverse professional background furnishes me with a unique blend of technical aptitude and people-centric skills. Whether crafting user-centric web solutions, leading community engagement initiatives, or overseeing customer service operations, I am adept at delivering value and augmenting user experiences. My comprehensive grasp of technology, coupled with a knack for fostering meaningful relationships, positions me well to contribute to projects at the nexus of technology, community, and customer satisfaction.
