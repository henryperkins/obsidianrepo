- Fundamental to system performance
- Prevents implementation bottlenecks

2. How does the system integrate with existing documentation tools and workflows?  
Justification:
- Essential for practical adoption
- Affects team workflow efficiency
- Important for continuous integration
- Reduces implementation friction
- Maximizes existing tooling investment

3. What are the cost implications and optimization strategies?  
Justification:
- Critical for budget planning
- Affects long-term sustainability
- Important for ROI assessment
- Essential for scale planning
- Helps prevent unexpected expenses

4. What are the specific performance benchmarks or metrics?  
Justification:
