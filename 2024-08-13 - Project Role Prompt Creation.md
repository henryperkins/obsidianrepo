Let's start by outlining what you want the system role prompt and custom instructions to accomplish for your future project. Here are a few questions to guide us:

1. **Project Goals:** What is the primary goal of your future project? Are you building a new application, improving an existing system, or working on something else?
2. **Target Audience:** Who will be the end users of this system? Is this role prompt designed for internal use by a development team, or is it something that end users will interact with?
3. **Functionality:** What specific features or capabilities should the system have? Are there any particular tasks or operations it needs to perform?
4. **AI Integration:** Will this project involve AI or machine learning components? If so, how do you envision those being used?
5. **User Interaction:** How do you want users to interact with the system? Should the AI be proactive, responsive, or offer suggestions?
6. **Constraints and Guidelines:** Are there any specific constraints, guidelines, or standards that should be followed in the development or use of this system?
7. **Tone and Style:** What kind of tone should the system have when interacting with users? Should it be formal, casual, technical, friendly, etc.?

Once I have a better understanding of these aspects, I can help craft a suitable system role prompt and custom instructions that align with your project's needs.
