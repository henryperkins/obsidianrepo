## Script Modifications to Support Subscription Tiers

To implement this subscription model in your script:

### 1. **Configuration Management**

   You'll need a configuration management system that can load different sets of configurations based on the user's subscription tier. This can be done by extending the `load_config` function in `core.py`.

```python
# core.py

def load_config(config_path='config.ini', tier='basic'):
    """Loads configuration settings based on subscription tier."""
    config = configparser.ConfigParser()
    
    try:
       if tier == 'basic':
           config.read('config_basic.ini')
       elif tier == 'pro':
           config.read('config_pro.ini')
       elif tier == 'enterprise':
           config.read('config_enterprise.ini')
       else:
           raise ValueError("Invalid subscription tier")
        
       return config
    except configparser.Error as e:
       logging.error(f"Error reading config file for {tier} tier: {e}")
       raise
```

### 2. **Feature Limitation Enforcement**

   Modify each module to check which features are enabled based on the current user's subscription level:

#### Metadata Extraction (`analysis.py`)

```python
def extract_metadata(filepath, tier='basic'):
   """Extracts enhanced video metadata using ffmpeg."""
   
   # Basic tiers only get essential metadata fields
   if tier == 'basic':
      metadata = {
         'duration': float(probe['format']['duration']),
         'codec': video_info.get('codec_name'),
         'width': video_info.get('width'),
         'height': video_info.get('height'),
      }
   
   # Pro & Enterprise tiers get more detailed fields
   elif tier in ['pro', 'enterprise']:
      metadata.update({
          'audio_codec': audio_info.get('codec_name'),
          'audio_channels': audio_info.get('channels'),
          'audio_sample_rate': audio_info.get('sample_rate'),
          'has_subtitle': bool(subtitle_info),
      })
   
   return metadata
```

#### Scene Detection (`analysis.py`)

```python
def detect_scenes(filepath, threshold=0.3, tier='basic'):
   """Detect scenes in the video using ffmpeg."""
   
   if tier == 'basic':
      threshold = 0.5  # Default threshold for basic users
   
   scenes = []
   
   try:
      ffmpeg_command = (
         ffmpeg.input(filepath)
         .filter('select', f'gt(scene,{threshold})')
         .output('dummy', vf='showinfo', format='null')
      )
      
      ffmpeg_output = ffmpeg_command.run(capture_stderr=True)[1]
      
      # Process output...
      
   except Exception as e:
      logging.error(f"Error during scene detection for {tier} user: {e}")
      return []

```

#### Qwen-VL Processing (`analysis.py`)

```python

class QwenVLProcessor:
    
    def __init__(self, model_dir):
       self.config = load_config()
       
       self.template_file = self.config.get(
           f'QwenVL_TemplateFile_{self.tier.upper()}', 
           fallback=f'templates_{self.tier}.txt'
       )
       
       self.load_templates()
    
# Load appropriate template files based on user’s subscription level 

def process_video(self):
     """Processes video content through multiple queries"""
     
     if self.tier == ‘basic’:
          questions = [“What is happening in this scene?”] 
     
     elif self.tier == ‘pro’:
          questions.extend([“Describe actions taking place”, “Identify objects”])
          
     else :
          questions.extend([“What sport is being played?”, “Is there any violence?”])
          
```

#### Tagging & Classification (`tagging.py`)

```python

def apply_tags(video_info,tier=‘basic’):
     """Applies rule-based tags depending upon extracted data"""
     
     tags=[]
     
     if ‘fps’ >30 :
         tags.append(‘High-FPS’) 
         
     if ‘width’ >=1920 :
         tags.append(‘HD’) 
         
         
# Add more granularity higher tiers
    
if ‘tier’==‘pro’ :
tags.append(‘Pro-Tagging-Rule’) 

elif ‘tier’==‘enterprise’ :
tags.append(‘Enterprise-Tagging-Rule’) 

return tags 

```

#### Export Functionality (`export.py`)

```python

import json,csv
    
def export_to_json(data output_dir,tier=‘basic’):
"""Exports processed data JSON format """
    
if not os.path.exists(output_dir) :
os.makedirs(output_dir) 
    
filepath=f"{output_dir}/{data['filename']}.json"

try : 
with open(filepath,'w') as f : 
json.dump(data,f indent=2) 

logging.info(f"Data exported {filepath}") 
    
except Exception as e : 
logging.error(f"Failed export data {filepath}:{e}") 
    
if ‘tier’== ‘pro’: 
export_to_csv(data output_dir): 

```

### 3. **Video Processing Limits**

Incorporate limits on how many videos a user can process per month based on their subscription level:

*You might require a simple database or file-based system track usage*

```python

# workflow.py 

import sqlite3,time
    
    
DB_FILE="usage.db"

def init_db():
conn=sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) 
cur=conn.cursor() 
    
cur.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usage (
user TEXT PRIMARY KEY ,
videos_processed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
last_reset TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP )""") 

conn.commit() conn.close() 

def check_usage(user,tier='basic'): 
conn=sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) cur=conn.cursor()

cur.execute("SELECT videos_processed FROM usage WHERE user=?", [user]) row=cur.fetchone()

if row :
videos_processed=row[0] else : 
        
cur.execute("INSERT INTO usage(user,videos_processed) VALUES (?,?)", [user ,0]) conn.commit()

videos_processed=0 
        
limit={
'basic ':10,
'pro ':100,
'enterprise ':None }[tier]

return videos_processed < limit

def increment_usage(user): conn.sqlite.connect(DB_FILE)

with conn.cursor() as cur : cur.execute("UPDATE usage SET videos_processed +=1 WHERE user=?", [user])
conn.commit()

# Usage Example:

if check_usage(user,tier):
process_video_pipeline(url)
increment_usage(user)

else : print ("Processing limit exceeded")

```

### Additional Considerations

*User Authentication*: You'll need some way authenticate users determine their current subscription level—this could involve API keys OAuth tokens etc depending upon platform architecture preferences!

*Cloud Integration*: If deploying SaaS service consider integrating w/cloud billing systems like AWS Billing GCP Billing ensure accurate tracking/charges customers!

*Automated Tier Upgrades*: Allow seamless upgrading/downgrading subscriptions via CLI commands frontend interface!
