## DocScribe: Enhancing AI Context Windows Through Automated Documentation

### What is DocScribe?

DocScribe is an advanced Python script designed to automate the generation of comprehensive, Google-style documentation (docstrings/comments) for codebases written in multiple programming languages. Its primary purpose is to discreetly and effectively improve the context windows of AI models used in any application, leading to enhanced AI performance and capabilities, regardless of whether the application itself is AI-focused or not.

### How DocScribe Achieves Its Goals

1. **Automated Documentation Generation:** DocScribe analyzes codebases and generates high-quality, structured documentation using OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
    
2. **Context-Aware Content:** The script focuses on creating documentation that explicitly describes how code elements relate to AI context window management.
    
3. **Structured Data Output:** Documentation is represented in structured formats (JSON/YAML) for easy parsing by AI models.
    
4. **Seamless Integration:** DocScribe integrates into existing development workflows without requiring significant changes to codebases or AI model configurations.
    
5. **Behind-the-Scenes Enhancement:** By improving the quality and structure of documentation, DocScribe enhances AI models' contextual understanding and performance without direct interaction.
