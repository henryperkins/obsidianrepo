# Apply_the_changes_in_[Untitled_2](Untitled_2.md)*to*[Adaptive Code Generation Assistant](./Adaptive%20Code%20Generation%20Assistant.md)@20241118_190906

**user**: Apply the changes in [api_interaction v2](api_interaction%20v2.md) to [Strategic Implementation of Azure OpenAI and LangChain with Pinecone](./Strategic%20Implementation%20of%20Azure%20OpenAI%20and%20LangChain%20with%20Pinecone.md)

**ai**: To apply the changes from `[[Untitled 2]]` to `[[Untitled]]`, we need to identify the relevant sections in `[[Untitled]]` that correspond to the updates described in `[[Untitled 2]]`. Since `[[Untitled]]` appears to be a collection of guides and resources, it's likely that the changes pertain to a specific implementation or codebase within those resources.

Here's a step-by-step approach to applying the changes:

1. **Identify the Relevant Codebase**: Determine which part of the `[[Untitled]]` document corresponds to the code changes described in `[[Untitled 2]]`. This might involve identifying a specific file or module, such as `api_interaction.py` or `docstring_utils.py`.
2. **Update the `_create_prompt` Method**: Locate the `_create_prompt` method in `api_interaction.py` within the relevant codebase. Update it to ensure the `summary` field is included and the `returns` field is correctly formatted as described in `[[Untitled 2]]`.
3. **Update the Response Processing**: Modify the `_process_response` method in `api_interaction.py` to handle the `summary` and `returns` fields correctly. Ensure that the response is validated and processed as per the new requirements.
4. **Update Schema Validation**: In `docstring_utils.py`, update the `DOCSTRING_SCHEMA` to require the `summary` and `returns` fields. This ensures that the generated docstrings conform to the updated schema.
5. **Test the Changes**: After making the changes, test the implementation to ensure that the errors are resolved and the docstrings are generated correctly. This might involve running unit tests or integration tests.
6. **Document the Changes**: Update any relevant documentation within `[[Untitled]]` to reflect the changes made to the codebase. This ensures that future developers understand the modifications and their purpose.

If you need further assistance in identifying specific sections or files within `[[Untitled]]`, or if additional context is required to apply these changes accurately, please provide more details about the structure or content of `[[Untitled]]`.
