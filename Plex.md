I want the plex media server publicly accessible

<p>To make your Plex Media Server publicly accessible, especially when it is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04.3, you should ensure both network and software configurations are properly set up. Here’s how to achieve this goal:</p>
<h3 data-heading="Step 1: Ensure Plex Server is Correctly Configured">Step 1: Ensure Plex Server is Correctly Configured</h3>
<p>After installing Plex Media Server on your EC2 instance, you need to access its settings to enable remote access.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access Plex Web Interface:</strong> Navigate to <code>http://your-EC2-public-IP:32400/web</code> from your browser to access the Plex web interface.</li>
<li><strong>Go to Settings:</strong> Click on the wrench and screwdriver icon at the top right corner to access the Settings menu.</li>
<li><strong>Enable Remote Access:</strong> Navigate to the "Remote Access" section from the Settings menu. Click on "Enable Remote Access" if it is not already enabled.</li>
</ol>
<h3 data-heading="Step 2: Configure Security Group in AWS">Step 2: Configure Security Group in AWS</h3>
<p>For your Plex Media Server to be publicly accessible, the correct ports must be opened in your EC2 instance’s security group. By default, Plex uses port 32400.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to AWS Management Console</strong> and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Select Security Groups:</strong> Find the security group associated with your Plex Media Server EC2 instance.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Inbound Rules:</strong> Click on the "Edit inbound rules" button.</li>
<li><strong>Add Rule:</strong> Add a new rule with the following settings:
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Custom TCP</li>
<li><strong>Port Range:</strong> 32400 (or whichever port you have set up for Plex).</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Custom <code>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</code> (this allows access from any IP address; for added security, you might want to restrict access to specific IP addresses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 data-heading="Step 3: Configure your Router (If Applicable)">Step 3: Configure your Router (If Applicable)</h3>
<p>If your EC2 instance is behind a NAT or you are under another layer of network, ensure that the port forwarding is correctly set up to forward traffic from the public IP to your EC2's private IP on the necessary port. This is unlikely in a straightforward EC2 setup but is important in nested network environments.</p>
<h3 data-heading="Step 4: Access Plex from Outside">Step 4: Access Plex from Outside</h3>
<p>Once you've configured both Plex to allow remote access and the AWS security group to allow traffic on the Plex port, you should be able to access your Plex Media Server using your EC2 instance's public IP address or DNS name followed by the port number, e.g., <code>http://ec2-public-ip:32400/web</code>.</p>
<h3 data-heading="Important Considerations:">Important Considerations:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Opening your Plex server to the Internet poses security risks. Ensure your server is always updated, use strong passwords, and consider restricting access to specific IP addresses if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Data Charges:</strong> AWS charges for data egress (data going out from AWS to the internet). Streaming media from your Plex server hosted on EC2 can increase your AWS bill significantly due to these charges.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> The EC2 instance type and your bandwidth allocation will influence streaming quality. Ensure the chosen instance type and network settings meet your requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps, you can make your Plex Media Server publicly accessible on an AWS EC2 instance. Always monitor your setup for any security threats and keep an eye on your AWS billing dashboard to avoid surprises.</p>
