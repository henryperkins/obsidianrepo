**ai**: The error message you're encountering indicates a circular import issue in your Python code. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can resolve it:

1. **Understand Circular Imports**: In Python, a circular import occurs when two or more modules import each other directly or indirectly, creating a cycle. This can lead to one of the modules being only partially initialized when it is imported.

2. **Check the Import Statements**: It seems like the problem arises between the `core.utils` and `core.extraction.function_extractor` modules. Specifically, `core.utils` is trying to import `FunctionExtractor` from `core.extraction.function_extractor`, which in turn tries to import `handle_extraction_error` from `core.utils`.

3. **Resolve the Circular Dependency**:
    - **Option 1**: Refactor the code to remove the circular dependency. You could move related functions to a separate module that both depend on, so they do not directly import each other.
    - **Option 2**: Use local imports. If the imports are needed only within specific functions or methods, you can move the import statements inside those functions to delay the import until it's actually needed.

4. **Check for Unused Imports**: Sometimes, imports exist that are not necessary. Cleaning up unnecessary imports might resolve the circular dependency.

5. **Reorganize Code**: Consider the overall design and structure of your modules. Sometimes, breaking a module into smaller, more focused modules can eliminate circular dependencies.

Here's how you might apply Option 2 (local imports) as a quick fix:

```python
# In core/extraction/function_extractor.py

# Move the import inside the function where 'handle_extraction_error' is used
def some_function():
    from core.utils import handle_extraction_error
    # rest of your function code

# In core/utils.py

# Move the import inside the function where 'FunctionExtractor' is used
def another_function():
    from core.extraction.function_extractor import FunctionExtractor
    # rest of your function code
```

After implementing these changes, try running your program again to see if the error is resolved.
